        This package provides Audio and Video Dexterity content types and behaviors,
        conversions and players/views.
        
        It integrates the HTML5 media player `mediaelementjs`_ and uses
        `plone.app.async`_ if installed to convert videos to common formats.
        
        .. _mediaelementjs: http://mediaelementjs.com 
        .. _plone.app.async: https://pypi.python.org/pypi/plone.app.async

        - Integration with `mediaelementjs`_ designed for maximum forward and
          backwards compatibility
        - Automatically convert video types to HTML5 compatible video formats
        - Be able to add video from TinyMCE by adding a link to the audio or video
          objects and then adding one of the available Audio and Video TinyMCE styles.
        - Integration with `plone.app.async`_ for conversions if installed
        - Plone 4.3 syndication support
        - Transcript data
        - Youtube URL  (in case you want the video streamed from Youtube)
        - Streaming support

        - Subtitle (captioning) file in SRT format
        
        Installation
        ------------
        
        In order for video conversion to work correctly, you'll need ``ffmpeg``
        installed which provides the ``avconv`` collection of command line utilities.
        
        On Ubuntu, you should be able to install with::
        
            sudo apt-get install libav-tools
        
        Plone 4
        ~~~~~~~
        
        Must have plone.app.jquery >= 1.8.3
        
        
        Conversion
        ----------
        
        Some versions of ``avconv`` may require extra arguments during the conversion
        process so that the conversion process succeeds and produces output files in
        a valid format. Extra ``infile`` and ``outfile`` options can be configured in
        the control panel::
        
            avconv [infile options] -i infile [outfile options] outfile
        
        The latest version of ``avconv`` on Ubuntu may require 
        ``-strict experimental`` as an ``outfile`` option.
        
        
        YouTube API Support
        -------------------
        
        Since version 2.0, YouTube integration is supported.
        Videos can automatically be uploaded to a configured YouTube account.
        
        Install
        ~~~~~~~
        
        Different install requirements::
        
            eggs = 
                ...
                wildcard.media[youtube]
                ...
        
        Then, setup a google api with oauth access and configure the 
        ``google_oauth_id`` and ``google_oauth_secret`` properties in the
        Configuration Registry.
        
        Finally, go to the url: http://plonesite/authorize-google
