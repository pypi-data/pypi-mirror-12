Description: django-cleanup automatically deletes files for FileField, ImageField, and
        subclasses. It will delete old files when a new file is being save and it
        will delete files on model instance deletion.
        
        **Warning! If you use transactions you may lose files if a transaction will
        rollback at the right instance. Though this outcome is reduced by our use of
        post_save and post_delete signals, this outcome will still occur if there are
        errors in signals that are handled after our signals are handled. In this case
        the old file will be lost and the new file will not be referenced in a model,
        though the new file will likely still exist on disk. If you are concerned about
        it you need another solution for old file deletion in your project.
        
        This is fixed in Django 1.9+ if you are using a database that supports
        transactions.**
        
        Features
        ========
        
        - Support for Django 1.6, 1.7, 1.8, 1.9
        - Python 3 support
        - Compatible with sorl-thumbnail and easy-thumbnail
        
        How does it work?
        =================
        
        django-cleanup connects post_init, post_save, and post_delete signals to special
        functions (these functions delete old files) for each model which app is listed
        in INSTALLED_APPS.
        
        Installation
        ============
        
            pip install django-cleanup
        
        
        Configuration
        =============
        
        Add django_cleanup to settings.py ::
        
            INSTALLED_APPS = (
                ...
                # should go after your apps in django 1.6.
                # in django 1.7+ this is fixed.
                'django_cleanup',
            )
        
        **django_cleanup** should be placed after all of your apps in django 1.6. (At
        least after those apps which need to remove files.) If you are using django 1.7+
        this is fixed with the new AppConfigs.
        
        
        
        Signals
        =======
        
        django-cleanup sends the following signals which can be imported from `django_cleanup.signals`:
        
        - **cleanup_pre_delete** just before a file is deleted. Passes a `file` keyword argument.
        - **cleanup_post_delete** just after a file is deleted. Passes a `file` keyword argument.
        
        Signals example for sorl.thumbnail
        ----------------------------------
        ::
        
            from django_cleanup.signals import cleanup_pre_delete, cleanup_post_delete
        
            def sorl_delete(**kwargs):
                from sorl.thumbnail import delete
                delete(kwargs['file'])
        
            cleanup_pre_delete.connect(sorl_delete)
        
        How to run tests
