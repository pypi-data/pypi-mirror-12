Description: 
        # testingbotclient
        
        Python client for TestingBot REST API
        
        ## Install
        
        ```shell
        pip install testingbotclient
        ```
        
        ## TestingBot
        [TestingBot](https://testingbot.com/) allows you to run your Selenium tests in the cloud.
        With access to over 400 different browser combinations, you can run your tests in parallel on their Selenium grid.
        
        ## Using the client
        
        ```python
        import testingbotclient
        
        tb = testingbotclient.TestingBotClient(
                    'key',
                    'secret'
                )
        print tb.tests.update_test("webdriverSessionId", 'my test name', False, 'test failure error')
        ```
        
        It is also possible to use `TESTINGBOT_KEY` and `TESTINGBOT_SECRET` environment variables instead of specifying these in the TestingBotClient constructor. Or use a `~/.testingbot` file with `key:secret`.
        
        ## Running tests
        
        This library is only intended to query the TestingBot API.
        To run Selenium RC/WebDriver tests with Python, please see [Python WebDriver Examples](http://testingbot.com/support/getting-started/python.html)
