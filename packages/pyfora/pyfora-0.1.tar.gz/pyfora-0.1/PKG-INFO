Description: pyfora - Compiled, parallel python
        ==================================
        
        pyfora is the client package for Ufora_ - a compiled, automatically parallel Python for data science
        and numerical computing.
        
        Ufora achieves speed and scale by reasoning about your python code to compile
        it to machine code (so it's fast) and find parallelism in it (so that it scales).  The Ufora
        runtime is fully fault tolerant, and handles all the details of data
        management and task scheduling transparently to the user.
        
        The Ufora runtime is invoked by enclosing code in a "ufora.remote" block. Code
        and objects are shipped to a Ufora cluster and executed in parallel across
        those machines. Results are then injected back into the host python
        environment either as native python objects, or as  handles (in case the
        objects are very large).  This allows you to pick the subset of your code that
        will benefit from running in Ufora - the remainder can run in your regular
        python environment.
        
        For all of this to work properly, Ufora places one major restriction on
        the code that it runs: it must be "pure", meaning that it cannot modify data
        structures or have side effects.  This restriction allows the Ufora runtime to
        agressively reorder calculations, which is crucial for
        parallelism, and allows it to perform compile-time
        optimizations than would not be possible otherwise. For more on the subset of python
        that Ufora supports, see `python restrictions`_.

        Installation
        ============
        
        The pyfora client is a pure python package and can be installed by running:
        
        .. code::
        
            pip install pyfora
        
        
        Getting Started with Ufora
        ==========================
        
        The ufora backend is available as a docker image that can be run locally on your machine, or in a 
        cluster of machines on a local network or in the cloud.
