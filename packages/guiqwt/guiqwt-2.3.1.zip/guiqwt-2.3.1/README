    Overview

	Based on PyQwt (plotting widgets for PyQt4 graphical user interfaces)
	and on the scientific modules NumPy and SciPy, guiqwt is a Python 
	library providing efficient 2D data-plotting features (curve/image 
	visualization and related tools) for interactive computing and 
	signal/image processing application development.
	
	Extension to PyQt4.Qwt5:
	  * set of tools for curve and image plotting
	  * GUI-based application development helpers

    Building/Installation

        All platforms:
            The setup.py script supports the following extra options for 
            optimizing the image scaler engine with SSE2/SSE3 processors:
                --sse2
                --sse3

        On GNU/Linux and MacOS platforms:
            python setup.py build install

        On Windows platforms with Microsoft Visual C/C++:
            python setup.py build install
