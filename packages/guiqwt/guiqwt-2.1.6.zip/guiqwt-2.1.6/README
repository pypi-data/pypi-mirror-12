    Overview

	Based on PyQwt (plotting widgets for PyQt4 graphical user interfaces)
	and on the scientific modules NumPy and SciPy, guiqwt is a Python 
	library providing efficient 2D data-plotting features (curve/image 
	visualization and related tools) for interactive computing and 
	signal/image processing application development.
	
	Extension to PyQt4.Qwt5:
	  * set of tools for curve and image plotting
	  * GUI-based application development helpers

    Dependencies
    
        Requirements
            Python 2.x (x>=5)
            PyQt4 4.x (x>=3 ; recommended x>=4)
            PyQwt 5.x (x>=2)
            guidata 1.3.2 or later
            NumPy 1.x (x>=3) -- NumPy 1.6 or later is required for Windows binaries
            SciPy 0.x (x>=7)
            PIL 1.1.x (x>=6)
            
	Optional modules
            spyderlib 2.0.x (x>=10) or 2.1 for Sift embedded Python console
	    pydicom v0.9.x (x>=4)

    Building/Installation

        All platforms:
            The setup.py script supports the following extra options for 
            optimizing the image scaler engine with SSE2/SSE3 processors:
                --sse2
                --sse3
    
        On GNU/Linux and MacOS platforms:
            python setup.py build install

	    If gfortran is not your default Fortran compiler:
	        python setup.py build --fcompiler=gfortran install
	    or if it fails, you may try the following:
	        python setup.py build_ext --fcompiler=gnu95 build install
	    
	On Windows platforms (requires MinGW with gfortran):
	    python setup.py build -c mingw32 install
