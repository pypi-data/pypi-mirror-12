    Overview

	Based on PyQwt (plotting widgets for PyQt4 graphical user interfaces)
	and on the scientific modules NumPy and SciPy, guiqwt is a Python 
	library providing efficient 2D data-plotting features (curve/image 
	visualization and related tools) for interactive computing and 
	signal/image processing application development.
	
	Extension to PyQt4.Qwt5:
	  * set of tools for curve and image plotting
	  * GUI-based application development helpers
