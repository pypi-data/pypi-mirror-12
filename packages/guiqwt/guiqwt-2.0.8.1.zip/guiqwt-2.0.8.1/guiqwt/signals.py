guiqwt.signals
--------------

The `signals` module contains constants defining the custom Qt SIGNAL objects 
used by `guiqwt`: the signals definition are gathered here to avoid mispelling
signals at connect and emit sites.

Signals available:
    :py:data:`guiqwt.signals.SIG_ITEM_MOVED`
        Emitted by IBasePlotItem object. Object was moved (args: x0, y0, x1, y1)
    :py:data:`guiqwt.signals.SIG_MARKER_CHANGED`
        Emitted by shapes.Marker when the position changes
    :py:data:`guiqwt.signals.SIG_AXES_CHANGED`
        Emitted by shapes.Axes when the position (or the angle) changes
    :py:data:`guiqwt.signals.SIG_ANNOTATION_CHANGED`
        Emitted by annotation.AnnotatedShape when the position changes
    :py:data:`guiqwt.signals.SIG_RANGE_CHANGED`
        Emitted by shapes.XRangeSelection when the range changes
    :py:data:`guiqwt.signals.SIG_ITEMS_CHANGED`
        Emitted by plot when item list has changed (item removed, added, ...)
    :py:data:`guiqwt.signals.SIG_ACTIVE_ITEM_CHANGED`
        Emitted by plot when selected item has changed
    :py:data:`guiqwt.signals.SIG_ITEM_REMOVED`
        Emitted by "itemlist" panel when an item was deleted from the list
    :py:data:`guiqwt.signals.SIG_ITEM_SELECTION_CHANGED`
        Emitted by plot when an item is selected
    :py:data:`guiqwt.signals.SIG_PLOT_LABELS_CHANGED`
        Emitted (by plot) when plot's title or any axis label has changed
    :py:data:`guiqwt.signals.SIG_AXIS_DIRECTION_CHANGED`
        Emitted (by plot) when any plot axis direction has changed
    :py:data:`guiqwt.signals.SIG_VOI_CHANGED`
        Emitted by "contrast" panel's histogram when the lut range of some items
        changed (for now, this signal is for guiqwt.histogram module's internal 
        use only - the 'public' counterpart of this signal is SIG_LUT_CHANGED, 
        see below)
    :py:data:`guiqwt.signals.SIG_LUT_CHANGED`
        Emitted by plot when LUT has been changed by the user
    :py:data:`guiqwt.signals.SIG_VISIBILITY_CHANGED`
        Emitted for example by panels when their visibility has changed
    :py:data:`guiqwt.signals.SIG_VALIDATE_TOOL`
        Emitted by an interactive tool to notify that the tool has just been 
        "validated", i.e. <ENTER>, <RETURN> or <SPACE> was pressed
