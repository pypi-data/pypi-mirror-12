What is Zhpy
--------------

Zhpy is the full feature python language with fully tested chinese
keywords, variables, and parameters support. Zhpy is INDEPENDENT on python
version(2.4, 2.5....), bundle with command line tool, interpreter,
bi-directional zhpy <-> python code translation,
chinese shell script capability, in-place ini reference feature
for keyword reuse, and great document (the book Byte of Python with chinese examples).

The core of zhpy is a lightweight python module and a chinese
source convertor based on python, which provides interpreter and
command line tool to translate zhpy code to python.

See http://www.flickr.com/photos/gasolin/2064120327

You could invoke interpreter with 'zhpy' command instead of "python" in command line to execute source code wrote in either Chinese or English.
The zhpy interpreter also support autocomplete function to save your typing.

Zhpy provide a method 'zh_exec' that allow you to embed
chinese script in python; Zhpy could be used as the chinese
shell script as well.

The zhpy code written in traditional and simplified chinese could be
translated and converted to natual python code.
Thus it could be execute as nature python code and be used in
normal python programs.

Bidirectional python-zhpy translation is possible.
Normal python programs could be translated to traditional(.twpy) or
simplified(.cnpy) chinese zhpy source via 'zhpy' command line tool.

The framework is not hard to extend to another languages such as japenese or korean.
