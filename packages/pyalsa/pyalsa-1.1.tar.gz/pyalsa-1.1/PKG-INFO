        Module was written for use with my cuisine video editor system
        (cuisine.bigasterisk.com).
        
        Currently supports opening pcm for nonblocking output and writing
        interleaved samples. I may add mixer support, as I wish to control
        my volume and sblive routing.
        
        Api is subject to change, but it will probably stay inspired by the
        alsa api and alsa example code.
