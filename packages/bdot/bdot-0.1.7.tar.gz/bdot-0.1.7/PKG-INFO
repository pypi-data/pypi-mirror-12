Description: 
        Bdot does big dot products (by making your RAM bigger on the inside). 
        It aims to let you do all the things you want to do with numpy, 
        but don't have enough memory for. You can also use it to save space
        in the cloud and quickly build production microservices.
        
        It's pretty math.
        
        Bdot is based on Bcolz and includes transparent disk-based storage. It was created 
        to simplify production implementation of nearest neighbor search and other fancy 
        machine learning rigmarole.
