Description: Python Word Segmentation
        ========================
        
        `WordSegment`_ is an Apache2 licensed module for English word
        segmentation, written in pure-Python, and based on a trillion-word corpus.
        
        Based on code from the chapter "`Natural Language Corpus Data`_" by Peter Norvig
        from the book "`Beautiful Data`_" (Segaran and Hammerbacher, 2009).
        
        Data files are derived from the `Google Web Trillion Word Corpus`_, as described
        by Thorsten Brants and Alex Franz, and `distributed`_ by the Linguistic Data
        Consortium. This module contains only a subset of that data. The unigram data
        includes only the most common 333,000 words. Similarly, bigram data includes
        only the most common 250,000 phrases. Every word and phrase is lowercased with
        punctuation removed.

        Quickstart
        ----------
        
        Installing WordSegment is simple with
        `pip <http://www.pip-installer.org/>`_::
        
            $ pip install wordsegmentation
        
        
        Tutorial
        --------
        
        In your own Python programs, you'll mostly want to use `segment` to divide a
        phrase into a list of its parts::
        
            >>> from wordsegmentation import Wordsegment
            >>> ws = WordSegment(use_google_corpus=True)
            
            >>> ws.segment('universityofwashington')
            ['university', 'of', 'washington']
            >>> ws.segment('thisisatest')
            ['this', 'is', 'a', 'test']  
            >>> segment('thisisatest')
            ['this', 'is', 'a', 'test']
