        Recent Changes
        ==============
        
        3.1.0 (2015-10-17)
        ------------------
        
        `dispatch()
        <https://jsonrpcserver.readthedocs.org/api.html#dispatcher.dispatch>`_ now
        accepts a dictionary of name:method pairs, as an alternative to the usual list
        of methods.
        
        3.0.0 (2015-10-11)
        ------------------
        
        Major update - much of the library has been rewritten. Although it works in much
        the same way as before, upgraders are advised to read the new `documentation
        <http://jsonrpcserver.readthedocs.org/>`_ to pick up the changes.
