Description: plorma README
        =============
        Plorma is a webapplication to plan, organise and manage tasks. While it tries to be as generic as possible it can be especially used as a simple issue or bug tracker in software development.
        
        Prerequisites
        -------------
        Plorma requires a PostgreSQL database. The default database (configured in the
        ini file) is named plorma. Please make sure this database is created and
        accessible before invoking the following commands.
        
        Getting Started
        ---------------
        
        - cd <directory containing this file>
        
        - $venv/bin/python setup.py develop
        
        - $venv/bin/plorma-admin db init
        
        The following steps are optional and only needed if you want to have some demo
        data to play around.
