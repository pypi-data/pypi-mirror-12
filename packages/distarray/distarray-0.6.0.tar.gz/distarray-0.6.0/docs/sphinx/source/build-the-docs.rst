Building the docs
-----------------

Dependencies to build the documentation:

* Sphinx >= 1.3
* sphinxcontrib.programoutput

If you have the dependencies listed above, and you want to build the
documentation (also available at http://distarray.readthedocs.org), navigate to
the ``docs/sphinx`` subdirectory of the DistArray source and use the Makefile there.

For example, to build the html documentation::

    make html

from the ``docs`` directory.

Try::

    make help

for more options.
