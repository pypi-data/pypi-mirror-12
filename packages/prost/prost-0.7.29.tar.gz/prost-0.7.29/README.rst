*Prost!* (PRocessing Of Small Transcripts) is a python application that
quantifies and annotates microRNA (miRNA) expression in chordates and
vertebrates with assembled genomes.  *Prost!* works by counting short
transcripts within a user-specifiable length range.  These counted transcripts
are aligned to a user specifiable genome allowing for post-transcriptional
modification (e.g. untemplated additions, editing, alternative cutting) and
then "binned" together based on genomic location.  Each bin is then annotated
with miRBase mature sequences and hairpins, as well as other types of RNA
obtained from Ensembl's Biomart.
