Description: About
        -----
        
        Dstat is a versatile replacement for vmstat, iostat, mpstat, netstat and
        ifstat. Dstat overcomes some of their limitations and adds some extra
        features, more counters and flexibility. Dstat is handy for monitoring
        systems during performance tuning tests, benchmarks or troubleshooting.
        
        This is a fork of dstat's plugins intended to maintain full compatibility
        version 1.7 of dstat, and any future released versions.
