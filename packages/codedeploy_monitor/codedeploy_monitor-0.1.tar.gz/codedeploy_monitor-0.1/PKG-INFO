Description: ***************************************************************
        CodeDeployMonitor, a simple monitoring tool for AWS CodeDeploy
        ***************************************************************
        
        
        
        CodeDeployMonitor is a little tool that can create new deployments for **AWS CodeDeploy**,
        and monitor them for successful completion. It also has a *monitor-only* mode, in case you create
        deployments via another tool (`aws-cli`_, for example).
        
        CodeDeployMonitor use the `boto3`_ library.
        
        ** This program is currently in pre-alpha state, so be aware of bugs.**
        
        ============
        Installation
        ============
        
        CodeDeployMonitor can easily be installed with `pip`_:
        
        .. code-block:: bash
        
            # Make sure we have an up-to-date version of pip and setuptools:
            $ pip install --upgrade pip setuptools
        
            $ pip install codedeploy-monitor
        
        
        =====
        Usage
        =====
        
        CodeDeployMonitor tries to mimic the `aws-cli`_ command-line parameters as close as possible. Both deployments from S3 and GitHub are supported.
        
        To create and monitor a new deployment:
        
        .. code-block:: bash
        
            $ codedeploy_monitor create-deployment --application-name my-app --deployment-group my-group  --s3-location bucket=my-bucket,key=releases/myapp.tgz,bundleType=tgz
        
        
        To monitor an existing deployment:
        
        .. code-block:: bash
        
            $ codedeploy_monitor monitor-deployment d-xxxxxxxxx
        
        
        Use the following commands to see a list of all command-line options:
        
        .. code-block:: bash
        
            $ codedeploy_monitor create-deployment --help
        
        .. code-block:: bash
        
            $ codedeploy_monitor monitor-deployment --help
