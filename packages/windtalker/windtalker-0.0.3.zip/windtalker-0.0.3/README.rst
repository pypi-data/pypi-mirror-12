In World War II, US Marine specially recruited a lots of bilingual Navajo speakers to serve in their standard communications units in the Pacific Theater. These Navajo transmitted tactical messages over military telephone or radio communications nets using formal or informally developed codes built upon their native languages. So Japanese is so freaked out to decrypt it. These people, we call them --- Wind Talker.

windtalker is a utility Python package built on top of `cryptography <https://pypi.python.org/pypi/cryptography>`_. With this, you can encrypt your files or entire directory using symmetric ciphers. If you use good secret key and ensure the safety of the key (like keep that in your mind), mostly it is very safe.
