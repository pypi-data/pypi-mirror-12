**Pure python module that provides async API calls for www.saaspass.com with tornado.**

This project provides the orcastorm.OrcaStorm class that implements API calls for www.saaspass.com, and lets you
easily create a web server that authenticates users with two factor authentication. This is an asynchronous library
that works with tornado's ioloop. High level methods of the orcastorm.OrcaStorm class are awaitable, and can
be used in a non-blocking way.

A demonstration webserver is provided in the test directory. In order to test it, you need to take the following steps:

1. Prepare a server that has a fully qualified domain name, and can run Python 3.5 with Tornado 4.3. You must also     have access to at least one email account within the given domain.

2. Download the saaspass app onto your phone, and create a new saaspass account.

3. Go to https://www.saaspass.com, login with your account using your phone.

4. Add your email address, to your account and verify it.

5. Go to enterprise mode on the saaspass website and add your domain name. You will become the admin of the domain.

6. Go to applications (in enterprise mode), and add a new "CUSTOM" type application. For the application, use the following parameters:

  * Give the IP of your server in the IP filter field (or use 0.0.0.0/0 if you want to use OTP logins from multiple devices.)

  * For testing, check "one time password", "scan barcode login" "instant registration" and "single sign on "functions.

  * Specify URLs for instant login and instant register. For the example application, this will be:

    * http://yourdomain.com:8080/saaspass_login - for instant login
    * http://yourdomain.com:8080/saaspass_register - for instant register
    * http://yourdomain.com:8080/saaspass_sso - for single sign on

  (You should use HTTPS on a production server, but you need to setup certificates for the server for that.)

7. Look up the API key and API password values, and copy them into the test/local.py file.

8. Start your server (test/main.py)

9. Point your browser to http://yourdomain.com:8080 and try the different login methods with your saaspass app.
