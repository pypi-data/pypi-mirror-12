        This repository contains a pure-Python implementation of a HTTP/2 protocol
        stack. It's written from the ground up to be embeddable in whatever program you
        choose to use, ensuring that you can speak HTTP/2 regardless of your
        programming paradigm.
        
        You use it like this::
        
            import h2.connection
        
            conn = h2.connection.Connection()
            frames, stream_id = conn.send_headers(headers)
            data_frames = conn.send_data(stream_id, data)
            events = conn.receive_data(socket_data)
        
        This repository does not provide a parsing layer, a network layer, or any rules
        about concurrency. Instead, it's a purely in-memory solution, defined in terms
        of data actions and HTTP/2 frames. This is one building block of a full Python
        HTTP implementation.
