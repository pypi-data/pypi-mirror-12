Description: # The Experiment Factory Python
        
        Python module for managing [experiment factory javascript experiment files](https://github.com/expfactory/expfactory-experiments), a [psiturk battery](https://github.com/expfactory/expfactory-battery), and a [virtual machine](https://github.com/expfactory/expfactory-vm) to host the compilation of these things.  We currently have support for just psiturk batteries, and other integrations will come shortly. You can use the functions to control these components, or just install the module and run to create an entire experiment using a web interface.
        
        Please see our [documentation](http://expfactory.github.io/expfactory-python) for more complete details.
        
        ### Installation
        
              pip install git+git://github.com/expfactory/expfactory-python.git
        
        
        ### Running to Generate a Battery
        Installation will place an executable, `expfactory` in your bin folder. To run the executable to open up a web interface to design your experiment:
        
              expfactory
        
        The web interface will take you through the following steps:
        
        - collection of experiment details
        - database connection validation
        - creation of local (folder) experiment, or deployment to AWS.
        
        ### Functions Provided
        If you want to use the library as a module, functions are provided that do the following.
        
        ###### experiment.py
        
        - validator for experiment format (json, etc) to add a new experiment
        - command line generation of new experiments
        
        ###### battery.py
        
        - functions to select a subset of experiments and generate a battery to run with psiturk
        
        ###### vm.py
        
        - functions for generating a new vm instance
        - should use functions from battery.py to select, create output, plug into vm, deploy
        
        ###### analysis.py
        
        - functions to do analyses, probably using db.py
        
        ###### db.py
        
        - functions for extracting stuff / working with database(s)
