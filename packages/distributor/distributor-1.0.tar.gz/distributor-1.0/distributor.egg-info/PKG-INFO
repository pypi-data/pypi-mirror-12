        ## What is it? ##
        
        When you have many frontend servers - it's a big headache to know, which of them listens your service now, especcially, if you recently moved some services between frontend balancers.
        
        **Distributor** is a web app, which can get Nginx and HAproxy configurations from your frontend servers,
        and clearly show which of your frontends listen each service and ip address.
        
        ## How it works? ##
        
        **Distributor** is a Script for generating html files.
        **Distributor** must have access to your GITlab server, where your frontends push their /etc/{nginx,haproxy} files.
        
        ## Run ##
        
        Add your GIT_HOST and GIT_TOKEN in **distributor.py** to get access repositories and fix url of your git server.
        
        Run `sudo -u apache sh -c 'cd /var/www/distributor && ./distributor.py'`
