- parameters.xml is generated from XLS by scripts/build_parameters_from_ipp_tax_and_benefit_tables.py
- param.py is probably obsolete
- preprocessing.py loads XML and patches it. It is only used by test_legislation.py
- ipp-tax-and-benefit-tables-to-parameters.yaml is written by hand and is a correspondence table between names in XML and names in TaxBenefitSystem
