Description: hackedit-cobol
        ======================
        
        A set of plugins that add COBOL support to `HackEdit`_.
        
        Features:
        ---------
        
        - `pyqode.cobol`_ editor integration (syntax highlighter, code completion, goto, code folding,...)
        - support for OpenCOBOL 1.1 and GnuCOBOL 2.0 compiler (MSVC based compiler are also supported on Windows)
        - support for custom parsers + premade setups for DBPRE and EsqlOC
        - two builtin workspaces:
        
          - project mode: specify which files are part of the project and compile them all at once.
          - single file mode: compile the current editor (very similar to OpenCobolIDE)
        
        - support for multiple compiler configuration (you can choose which config is the main one and you can select secondary configuration to be run when you build your project/file).
        - tool for computing field offset
        
        
        In the future, we plan to add the following features:
        
        - GnuCOBOL 2 debugger integration
        - Support for standard build tools (makefile, autotools)
        
        
        Requirements
        ------------
        
        - `hackedit`_
        - `pyqode.cobol`_
        
        .. _HackEdit: http://github.com/ColinDuquesnoy/HackEdit
        .. _pyqode.cobol: https://pypi.python.org/pypi/pyqode.cobol
        
        
        Installation
        ------------
        
        ::
        
           pip3 install hackedit-cobol --upgrade
        
        The plugin does not provide the GnuCOBOL compiler, you need to install it by yourself:
        
        - on **Windows**, the plugin will try to use the compiler bundled with `OpenCobolIDE`_.
        - on **OSX**, you can easily install the compiler by running ``brew install gnu-cobol`` or ``brew install gnu-cobol --devel`` for GnuCOBOL 2.0
        - on **GNU/Linux**, you should use your package manager or install from source if it is not available (you will likely find the ``open-cobol`` or ``gnu-cobol`` package)
