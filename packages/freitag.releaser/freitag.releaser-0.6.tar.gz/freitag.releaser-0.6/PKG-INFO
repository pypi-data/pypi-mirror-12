        Release facilities to ease the management of buildout based projects.
        
        Standing on the shoulder of giants
        ==================================
        This distribution intends to be as small as possible by integrating a few custom release choices done by the `der Freitag`_ development team.
        
        For that it heavily relies on a couple of well known distributions:
        
        - `plone.releaser`_
        - `zest.releaser`_
        
        What's in?
        ==========
        A few zest.releaser plugins that:
        
        - check that the git repository is updated *update_git_branch*
        - update development branches after a release *update_develop_branches*
        - check translation files are updated *check_translations*
        
        Additions to plone.releaser:
        
        - ability to release a distribution within the parent (buildout) project
        
          - check to ensure the correct branch on the parent project is used *check_zope_branch*
          - check that the distribution about to release exists *check_folders*
          - update versions.cfg with the new released version *update_versions_cfg*
        
        - gather the changes on distributions (more than only *collect_changelog*)
        - push cfg files *publish_cfg_files*
        - check which distributions need a release
        - **(TODO)**: update batou version pins (components/{plone,zeo}/versions/versions.cfg

        0.1 (2015-11-11)
        ----------------
        - add zest.releaser plugins:
        
          - vcs_updated: checkouts master and develop branches,
            rebases the former on top of the later (master catches up with develop)
            and leaves the checked out branch as master,
            ready to be released
          - i18n: runs ``bin/i18ndude find-untranslated`` and reports back if there
            are any strings not marked for translation
          - update_branches: the oposite from vcs_updated,
            rebased develop branch on top of master (which was used to make the release)
        
          [gforcada]
        
        - emulate ``plone.releaser`` and create a ``freitag_manage`` command with:
        
          - publish_cfg_files: send two specific files to a specific server
          - release: releases a distribution (with ``zest.releaser``)
        
          [gforcada]
        
        - initial release
