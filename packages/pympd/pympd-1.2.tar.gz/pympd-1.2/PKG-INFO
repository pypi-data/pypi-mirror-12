Description: An alternative to the commonly-used mpdclient
        module (http://mpd.wikicities.com/wiki/ClientLib:py-libmpdclient)
        which uses twisted for the TCP communications. Important differences
        between mpdclient and pympd:
        
        - pympd doesn't fall into 'not done processing current command' loops
        
        - pympd doesn't block, due to its use of the twisted communications libs
        
        - pympd has a very incomplete implementation of the mpd commands, but
        they are easy to add
        
        - pympd supports my mpd patch for fractional-second accurate times,
        and might even reject unpatched mpds
