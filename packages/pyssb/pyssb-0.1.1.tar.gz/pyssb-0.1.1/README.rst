pyssb
=====

pyssb is a package for building general purpose SSBs (Site Specific
Browsers) with PyQT5.

Installation
------------

You should be able to install the pyssb package via PyPI:

::

    sudo pip install -U pyssb

You of course will need to install PyQT5 as well, but this probably
needs to be installed via your OS package manager. You may have to
separately install a PyQT5 webkit package separately.

Usage
-----

You should be able to run ``pyssb`` to generate simple python
executables.

If you would like to use pyssb, here’s a simple example of what is
generated by the ``pyssb`` generator:

.. code:: python

    from   PyQt5 import QtWidgets
    from   pyssb import *
    import sys

    ssb_config = {'name':'pyssb','title':'pyssb','url':'https://github.com/lhl/pyssb/'}

    if __name__ == "__main__":
      app = QtWidgets.QApplication(sys.argv)
      ssb = SSBWindow(ssb_config)
      ssb.show()
      sys.exit(app.exec_())

See the `samples folder <https://github.com/lhl/pyssb/tree/master/samples>`_ for more examples.
