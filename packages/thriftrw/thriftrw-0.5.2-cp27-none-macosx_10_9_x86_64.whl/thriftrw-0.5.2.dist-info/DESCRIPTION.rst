Features
--------

* No code generation. The ``.thrift`` files are parsed and compiled in-memory
  at runtime.
* No assumptions about how bytes are sent or received. The library
  concerns itself with serialization and deserialization only.
* Supports Python 2 and 3.
* Forward and cyclic references in types.

Example
-------

Given the ``.thrift`` file,::

    // blog.thrift

    typedef string PostUUID

    typedef binary RichText

    union Body {
        1: string plainText
        2: RichText richText
    }

    struct PostDetails {
        1: required string author
        2: required string subject
        3: required Body body
    }

    exception UnauthorizedRequestError {
    }

    service BlogService {
        PostUUID newPost(1: PostDetails post)
            throws (1: UnauthorizedRequestError unauthorized);
    }


You can use the library to send and receive requests and responses like so,

.. code-block:: python

    # client.py

    import thriftrw

    blog = thriftrw.load('blog.thrift')
    BlogService = blog.BlogService

    def new_post():
        post = blog.PostDetails(
            author='...',
            subject='...',
            body=blog.Body(plainText='Hello, world!')
        )

        request = BlogService.newPost.request(post)
        payload = blog.dumps(request)

        # send_to_server is implemented by the user.
        response_payload = send_to_server(payload)
        response = blog.loads(BlogService.newPost.response, response_payload)
        if response.unauthorized is not None:
            raise response.unauthorized
        else:
            return response.success


.. code-block:: python

    # server.py

    import thriftrw

    blog = thriftrw.load('blog.thrift')
    BlogService = blog.BlogService

    # The user's server handler calls handle_new_post with the payload.
    def handle_new_post(request_payload):
        request = blog.loads(BlogService.newPost.request, request_payload)
        if request.post.author != 'admin':
            response = BlogService.newPost.response(
                unauthorized=blog.UnauthorizedRequestError()
            )
        else:
            # create_post is implemented by the user.
            post_uuid = create_post(request.post)
            response = BlogService.newPost.response(success=post_uuid)

        return blog.dumps(response)

Caveats
-------

* Only the Thrift Binary protocol is supported at this time.
* Message wrappers for Thrift calls and responses are not supported at this
  time.
