Description: plut
        ====
        
        When you're building several web apps simultaneously (increasingly
        common in the microservice age) it's annoying to remember which app is
        on which port.  plut (port lookup table) does it for you.
        
        To install, run ``pip install plut``. I think there's also a tool
        called ``easy_install`` but I don't know how to use that.
        
        Usage
        -----
        
        The point of plut is to remember what app is running where. plut does
        this by mapping names to ports.  To get the port corresponding to a
        name, run: ::
        
          import plut
        
          port = plut.port('myservice') # returns an int
        
        plut saves this inside ``~/.plutfile``.  The next time you run
        ``plut.port``, it'll check if a port already exists and if so, give
        you that instead.
        
        You can also do this from the command-line: ::
        
          plut            # lists all services
          plut rm <name>  # remove a service
          plut <name>     # get the port of a service
