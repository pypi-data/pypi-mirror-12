This is a suite of various semi-related software concerning MersenneForum's
Aliquot sequences forum. Of most note is the website that maintains the current
status of all sequences less than 10^6 -- its primary script, as well as all
HTML templates, are included in this repository. The primary script relies on
the various other things located here as well.

The website/ folder contains the relevant HTML/JS/CSS/etc.

The scripts/ folder contains the main website script, as well as the
reservations tracking script, a small script to find sequences with drivers
susceptible to breaking, and the merge detecting script.

The mfaliquot/ package contains the numtheory.py and aliquot.py modules
I wrote while I was talking a number theory course -- the former module has a
lot of unrelated-to-aliquot material, but has a bunch of relevant stuff as well,
which aliquot.py and in turn the website and other scripts depend on.

The fdb/ pseudo-package can be ignored for now. (I had the ambitious idea of
writing a Python package that extends some HTML parsing done in the scripts/
folder into a complete FDB "API" that interacts with the HTML. Work halted for
the forseeable future.)

folder, which contains external projects) is copyright by Dubslow (aka Bill
Winslow), and is licensed under the GPL. See LICENSE for details.
