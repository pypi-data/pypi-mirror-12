Description: A simple pep8 quality test
        ==========================
        
        First, this was taken from edx-platform and modified to reach my own goals.
        
        Do you think your code is clean??!!
        
        run quality_test on your home directory and find out how many violations your code have.
        
        Simple installation using pip:
        
        "pip install pep-quality"
        
        use the following to test your code:
        
        "
        from path import Path as path
        
        from pep_quality.quality import run_quality
        
        ...
        
        run_quality(path(__file__).abspath(), None)
        "
        
        or you can just call from python manage.py shell like:
        
        "
        from path import Path as path
        
        from pep_quality.quality import run_quality
        
        ...
        
        run_quality(path('.').abspath(), None)
        "
