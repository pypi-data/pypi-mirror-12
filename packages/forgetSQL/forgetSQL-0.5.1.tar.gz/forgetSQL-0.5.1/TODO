TODO for forgetSQL
==================

 * rollback/commits
   how to do it in programs using forgetSQL?
   how to do it internally?

 * objects should timeout as well, but what should happen?
   raise TimeOutException ? 
   Try a passive reload, and only raise exception if something has
   changed in the database?

 * generator should take parameters for database connection details
 
 * generator should try to fetch table lists from mysql/postgresql
   if possible

 * generated framework (_Wrapper and it's like) needs to be 
   refactored - to make it easier to set database cursor and
   module. Could the set-module be avoided?

   Framework should include the suggestion of specializing in a
   subclassing module - to allow regeneration.
 
 * getAll* should try to use the _cache - but what about
   getAllIterator and the useObject?

   Maybe the getAll-things should be changed, when using getAll but not
   loading datas be appropriate? 

   What about loading data immediately to _values, but skip
   instanciating _userClasses until __getattr__ ?

 * Include attributes in dir()
   -- how to do this? Skip the _values dictionary? There is another
   method almost like __getattr__ that I don't remember, it is 
   called for EVERY attribute access, not just the non-existing ones.
   Use this?

 * Only fields changed should be stored in an UPDATE

 * connection details should be made easier to set

 * documentation, documentation, documentation!
   More examples, please!
   -- README added, but needs more work
