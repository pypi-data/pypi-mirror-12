A TOML serializer/deserializer for Python that tries its best to preserve order of table mappings, formatting of source file, and comments during a deserialize/update/serialize job. This is achieved by preserving the parsed/constructed TOML data structures as lexical tokens internally and having the data manipulations performed directly on the tokens.
