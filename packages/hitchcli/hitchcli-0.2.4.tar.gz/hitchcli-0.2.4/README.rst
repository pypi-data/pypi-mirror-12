HitchCLI
========

HitchCLI is a plugin for the Hitch test framework that lets you test
command line applications. It includes a wrapper around pexpect to
let you write steps to interact with interactive command line
applications.

WARNING : The API for HitchCLI is currently very unstable. It will
change frequently and without warning. It is recommended that you
wait a few weeks before using it.
