 This logger service logs everything the syslogd service receives
into subdirectories of /var/log/syslogd/ logdir.

 The script provided in env/LOGSCRIPT emulates the default
syslogd behaviour on a majority of Linux distributions.

 Note that spaces cannot be used as is in the LOGSCRIPT file,
because they are delimiters for the splitting of $LOGSCRIPT
in the run script. So \s is used instead.
