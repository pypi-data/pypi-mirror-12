This is the image of the control directory of the s6-svscan process
running as pid 1.
"crash" is run if s6-svscan fails.
"finish" is run when s6-svscan exits its loop.

 The "SIG*" files are run as children of s6-svscan when it receives
the corresponding signal. SIGINT, SIGUSR1 and SIGUSR2 will all
trigger "s6-rc -da change" (the service manager will shut down all
the services), then s6-svscan will be told to exit its loop.
