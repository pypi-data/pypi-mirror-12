<h1> The s6-svscan program </h1>

<p>
s6-svscan starts and monitors a collection of <a href="s6-supervise.html">s6-supervise</a>
processes, each of these processes monitoring a single service. It is designed to be either
the root or a branch of a <em>supervision tree</em>.
</p>

<h2> Interface </h2>

<pre>
     s6-svscan [ -c max ] [ -t <em>rescan</em> ] [ <em>scandir</em> ]
</pre>

<ul>
 <li> If given a <em>scandir</em> argument, s6-svscan switches to it. Else it uses
its current directory as <a href="scandir.html">scan directory</a>. </li>
 <li> It exits 100 if another s6-svscan process is already monitoring this
<a href="scandir.html">scan directory</a>. </li>
 <li> If the <tt>./.s6-svscan</tt> control directory does not exist,
s6-svscan creates it. However, it is recommended to already have a <tt>.s6-svscan</tt>
subdirectory in your scan directory, because s6-svscan may try and execute into the
<tt>.s6-svscan/crash</tt> or <tt>.s6-svscan/finish</tt> files at some point - so those
files should exist and be executable. </li>
 <li> From this point on, s6-svscan never dies. It tries its best to keep
control of what's happening. In case of a major system call failure, which means
that the kernel or hardware is broken in some fashion, it executes into the
<tt>.s6-svscan/crash</tt> program. (But if that execution fails, s6-svscan exits
111.) </li>
 <li> s6-svscan performs an initial <em>scan</em> of its scan directory. </li>
 <li> s6-svscan then occasionally runs <em>scans</em> or <em>reaps</em>,
see below. </li>
 <li> s6-svscan runs until it is told to stop via <a href="s6-svscanctl.html">
s6-svscanctl</a>, or a signal.
Then it executes into the <tt>.s6-svscan/finish</tt> program. The program is
given an argument that depends on the s6-svscanctl options that were used. </li>
 <li> If that execution fails, s6-svscan falls back on a <tt>.s6-svscan/crash</tt>
execution. </li>
</ul>

<h2> Options </h2>

<ul>
 <li> <tt>-c&nbsp;<em>max</em></tt>&nbsp;: maintain services for up to <em>max</em>
service directories. Default is 500. Lower limit is 2. There is no upper limit, but:
 <ul>
  <li> The higher <em>max</em> is, the more stack memory s6-svscan will use,
approximately 50 bytes per service. </li>
  <li> s6-svscan uses 2 file descriptors per logged service. </li>
 </ul>
 It is the admin's responsibility to make sure that s6-svscan has enough available
descriptors to function properly and does not exceed its stack limit. The default
of 500 is safe and provides enough room for every reasonable system. </li>
 <li> <tt>-t&nbsp;<em>rescan</em></tt>&nbsp;: perform a scan every <em>rescan</em>
milliseconds. If <em>rescan</em> is 0, automatic scans are never performed after
the first one and s6-svscan will only detect new services when told to via a
<a href="s6-svscanctl.html">s6-svscanctl -a</a> command. The default <em>rescan</em>
value is 5000, for compatibility with daemontools'
<a href="http://cr.yp.to/daemontools/svscan.html">svscan</a>, which performs a
scan (and a reap) every 5 seconds. It is <em>strongly</em> discouraged to set
<em>rescan</em> to a positive value under 500. </li>
</ul>

<h2> Signals </h2>

<p>
 s6-svscan reacts to the following signals:
</p>

<ul>
 <li> SIGCHLD&nbsp;: triggers the reaper. </li>
 <li> SIGALRM&nbsp;: triggers the scanner. </li>
 <li> SIGTERM&nbsp;: acts as if a <tt>s6-svscanctl -t</tt> command had been received. </li>
 <li> SIGHUP&nbsp;: acts as if a <tt>s6-svscanctl -h</tt> command had been received. </li>
 <li> SIGQUIT&nbsp;: acts as if a <tt>s6-svscanctl -q</tt> command had been received. </li>
 <li> SIGABRT&nbsp;: acts as if a <tt>s6-svscanctl -b</tt> command had been received. </li>
 <li> SIGINT&nbsp;: acts as if a <tt>s6-svscanctl -6</tt> command had been received. </li>
 <li> SIGUSR1&nbsp;: acts as if a <tt>s6-svscanctl -7</tt> command had been received. </li>
</ul>

<h2> The reaper </h2>

<p>
 Upon receipt of a SIGCHLD, or a <a href="s6-svscanctl.html">s6-svscanctl -z</a>
command, s6-svscan runs a <em>reaper</em> routine.
</p>

<p>
The reaper acknowledges (via some
<a href="http://pubs.opengroup.org/onlinepubs/9699919799/functions/wait.html">wait()</a>
function), without blocking, every terminated child of s6-svscan, even ones it does not
know it has. This is especially important when <a href="s6-svscan-1.html">s6-svscan is
run as process 1</a>.
</p>

<p>
 If the dead child is a <a href="s6-supervise.html">s6-supervise</a> process watched
by s6-svscan, and the last scan flagged that process as active, then it is restarted
one second later.
</p>

<h2> The scanner </h2>

<p>
 Every <em>rescan</em> milliseconds, or upon receipt of a SIGALRM or a
<a href="s6-svscanctl.html">s6-svscanctl -a</a> command, s6-svscan runs a
<em>scanner</em> routine.
</p>

<p>
 The scanner scans the current directory for subdirectories (or symbolic links
to directories), which must be <a href="servicedir.html">service directories</a>.
It skips names starting with dots. It will not create services for more than
<em>max</em> subdirectories.
</p>

<p>
 For every new subdirectory <em>dir</em> it finds, the scanner spawns a
<a href="s6-supervise.html">s6-supervise</a> process on it. If
<em>dir</em><tt>/log</tt> exists, it spawns a s6-supervise process on
both <em>dir</em> and <em>dir</em><tt>/log</tt>, and maintains a
never-closing pipe from the service's stdout to the logger's stdin.
This is <em>starting the service</em>, with or without a corresponding
logger.
Every service the scanner finds is flagged as "active".
</p>

<p>
 The scanner remembers the services it found. If a service has been
started in an earlier scan, but the current scan can't find the corresponding
directory, the service is then flagged as inactive. No command is sent
to stop inactive s6-supervise processes (unless the administrator
uses <a href="s6-svscanctl.html">s6-svscanctl -n</a>), but inactive
s6-supervise processes will not be restarted if they die.
</p>

<h2> Implementation notes </h2>

<ul>
 <li> s6-svscan is designed to run until the machine is shut down. It is
also designed as a suitable candidate for
<a href="s6-svscan-1.html">process 1</a>. So, it goes out of its way to
stay alive, even in dire situations. When it encounters a fatal situation,
something it really cannot handle, it executes into <tt>.s6-svscan/crash</tt>
instead of dying; when it is told to exit, it executes into
<tt>.s6-svscan/finish</tt>. Administrators should make sure to design
appropriate <tt>crash</tt> and <tt>finish</tt> routines. </li>
 <li> s6-svscan is a fully asynchronous state machine. It will read and
process commands at any time, even when the computer is in trouble. </li>
 <li> s6-svscan <em>does not use malloc()</em>. That means it will <em>never leak
memory</em>. <small>However, s6-svscan uses opendir(), and most opendir()
implementations internally use heap memory - so unfortunately, it's impossible
to guarantee that s6-svscan does not use heap memory at all.</small> </li>
 <li> When run with the <tt>-t0</tt> option, s6-svscan <em>never polls</em>,
it only wakes up on notifications, just like s6-supervise. The s6 supervision
tree can be used in energy-critical environments. </li>
</ul>
