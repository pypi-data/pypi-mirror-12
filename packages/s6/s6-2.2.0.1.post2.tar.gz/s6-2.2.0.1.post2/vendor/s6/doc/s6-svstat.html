<h1> The s6-svstat program </h1>

<p>
s6-svstat prints a short, human-readable summary of the state of a process
monitored by <a href="s6-supervise.html">s6-supervise</a>.
</p>

<h2> Interface </h2>

<pre>
     s6-svstat [ -n ] <em>servicedir</em>
</pre>

<p>
 s6-svstat gives information about the process being monitored
at the <em>servicedir</em> <a href="servicedir.html">service directory</a>, then
exits 0. The information includes the following:
</p>

<ul>
 <li> whether the process is up or down, and if it's up, the number of
seconds that it has been up. </li>
 <li> the process' pid, if it is up, or its last exit code or terminating
signal, if it is down </li>
 <li> what its default state is, if it is different from its current state </li>
 <li> the number of seconds since it last changed states </li>
 <li> if the current state is transient and will change as soon as the
kernel's scheduler picks up s6-supervise </li>
 <li> whether the service is <a href="notifywhenup.html">ready</a>,
as notified by the daemon itself, and
if it is, the number of seconds that it has been.
A service reported as down and ready simply means that it is ready
to be brought up. A service is down and not ready when it is in the
cleanup phase, i.e. the <tt>./finish</tt> script is still being executed. </li>
 </li>
</ul>

<h2> Options </h2>

<ul>
 <li> <tt>-n</tt>&nbsp;: if the monitored process has been killed by a signal,
print the signal number. By default, a symbolic name for the signal will be
printed instead. </li>
</ul>
