<h1> The s6-svlisten program </h1>

<p>
 s6-svlisten runs a program while listening on notifications from
a collection of supervised services, and blocks until they all go up, or down.
</p>

<p>
 s6-svlisten only waits for notifications; it never polls.
</p>

<h2> Interface </h2>

<p>
 In an execline script:
</p>

<pre>
     s6-svlisten [ -U | -u | -D | -d ] [ -a | -o ] [ -t <em>timeout</em> ] { <em>servicedir</em> <em>servicedir...</em> } <em>prog...</em>
</pre>

<p>
 Outside of an execline script:
</p>

<pre>
     s6-svlisten [ -U | -u | -D | -d ] [ -a | -o ] [ -t <em>timeout</em> ] <em>servicedir</em> <em>servicedir...</em> "" <em>prog...</em>
</pre>

<ul>
 <li> s6-svlisten checks the state of one or more <a href="servicedir.html">service
directories</a> given as arguments in the first block and monitor
their state changes. </li>
 <li> It spawns <em>prog...</em> as a child right after getting the
initial state of all the monitored services. </li>
 <li> It then blocks until the wanted state happens, then exits 0. </li>
</ul>

<h2> Options </h2>

<ul>
 <li> <tt>-u</tt>&nbsp;: up. s6-svlisten will wait until the services are up, as
reported by s6-supervise.
This is the default; it is not reliable, but it does not depend on specific
support in the service programs. See <a href="notifywhenup.html">this page</a>
for details. </li>
 <li> <tt>-U</tt>&nbsp;: really up. s6-svlisten will wait until the services are
up <em>and</em> ready as reported by the services themselves. This requires
specific support in the service programs, and the use of the
<tt>notification-fd</tt> file in the
<a href="servicedir.html">service directory</a>.
See the explanation on <a href="notifywhenup.html">this page</a>. </li>
 <li> <tt>-d</tt>&nbsp;: down. s6-svlisten will wait until the services are down. </li>
 <li> <tt>-D</tt>&nbsp;: really down. s6-svlisten will wait until the
services are down and the cleanup scripts in <tt><em>servicedir</em>/finish</tt>
for every <em>servicedir</em>
have finished executing (or have timed out and been killed). </li>
 <li> <tt>-o</tt>&nbsp;: or. s6-svlisten will wait until <em>one</em> of the
given services comes up or down. </li>
 <li> <tt>-a</tt>&nbsp;: and. s6-svlisten will wait until <em>all</em> of the
given services come up or down. This is the default. </li>
 <li> <tt>-t&nbsp;<em>timeout</em></tt>&nbsp;: if the requested events have not
happened after <em>timeout</em> milliseconds, s6-svlisten will print a message
to stderr and exit 1. By default, <em>timeout</em> is 0, which means no time
limit. </li>
</ul>

<h2> Notes </h2>

<ul>
 <li> s6-svlisten is the service-specific version of
<a href="s6-ftrig-listen.html">s6-ftrig-listen</a>. The point of s6-svlisten
is to use it to spawn a program such as <a href="s6-svc.html">s6-svc</a>,
in order to send signals to services while making sure to catch their
state changes - thus avoiding the race condition that occurs when running
<a href="s6-svc.html">s6-svc</a> then <a href="s6-svwait.html">s6-svwait</a>
sequentially. </li>
 <li> s6-svlisten needs to handle a variable length list of service directories.
For that, it uses an encoding provided by
<a href="http://skarnet.org/software/execline/">execline</a>, so it's best
to only use it in execline scripts (only the execline syntax is guaranteed
not to change). There is a variant of s6-svlisten that does not use execline
syntax, but only handles one service directory:
<a href="s6-svlisten1.html">s6-svlisten1</a>. </li>
</ul>
