sxclient: Python SX client-side library
=======================================

Introduction
------------

sxclient is a library which implements client-side methods for communicating
with an SX Cluster. Using the provided objects and functions, it is possible to
prepare and send a query as per the API documentation at
http://docs.skylable.com/.

Internally, sxclient uses requests library (http://python-requests.org/) and
currently requires Python 2.7.


Usage
-----

In order to run an operation provided by the library, you have to perform some
preparatory actions:

- prepare a Cluster object, containing cluster location data;
- prepare a UserData object, containing user credentials used to authorize
  operations;
- prepare a ClusterSession object which serves as a context for the connections
  with the cluster.

Afterwards, you can run a series of operations using the previously created
ClusterSession object as a context.


Initializing Cluster object
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

The most basic way of initializing the Cluster object is to pass the cluster
name:

::

   cluster = sxclient.Cluster('my.cluster.example.com')

If the passed name is not a FQDN, you should pass an IP address too. It will be
used to communicate with the cluster in place of name.

::

   cluster = sxclient.Cluster('clustername', ip_address='127.0.0.1')

In case you don't want the connection to be secured by SSL, set ``is_secure``
to ``False``:

::

   cluster = sxclient.Cluster('my.cluster.example.com', is_secure=False)

You can also pass a custom port number:

::

   cluster = sxclient.Cluster('my.cluster.example.com', port=8000)


Initializing UserData object
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

There are multiple initialization methods for UserData. You can provide a path
to the key file:

::

   user_data = sxclient.UserData.from_key_path('/path/to/keyfile')

The key itself can be provided too â€” either encoded in base64:

::

   user_data = sxclient.UserData.from_key('ZP1rHyR0QB6zEvCwYexGl9SF1G143C/D2hG9rEisLL2zJV3kWQvtAwAA')

or in its binary form:

::

   user_data = sxclient.UserData('d\xfdk\x1f$t@\x1e\xb3\x12\xf0\xb0a\xecF\x97\xd4\x85\xd4mx\xdc/\xc3\xda\x11\xbd\xacH\xac,\xbd\xb3%]\xe4Y\x0b\xed\x03\x00\x00')

You can also initialize the object with username and password (and cluster
UUID):

::

   user_data = sxclient.UserData.from_userpass_pair('a_user', 'a_password', '10ca10ca-10ca-10ca-10ca-10ca10ca10ca')


Initializing ClusterSession object
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

After preparing Cluster and UserData objects, a ClusterSession object can be
created.

::

   session = sxclient.ClusterSession(cluster, user_data)

For secure connections the library verifies SSL certificates by default. You
can turn off the verification by passing ``False`` in ``verify`` parameter:

::

   session = sxclient.ClusterSession(cluster, user_data, verify=False)

In order to use a custom CA certificate for verification, pass a path to CA
bundle in ``verify`` parameter:

::

   session = sxclient.ClusterSession(cluster, user_data, verify='/path/to/ca/bundle')

At the end you should close the session with ``session.close()``. It is advised
to use ClusterSession as a context manager:

::

   with sxclient.ClusterSession(cluster, user_data) as session:
       # run operations


Running an operation
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Currently the following operations are available::

   listUsers
   listVolumes
   createUser
   modifyUser
   removeUser
   listNodes
   getClusterStatus
   getNodeStatus
   getClusterMetadata
   setClusterMetadata
   locateVolume
   createVolume
   modifyVolume
   deleteVolume
   getVolumeACL
   setVolumeACL
   updateVolumeACL

For more information regarding usage of a specific operation function see its
docstring. For example, to see the description for ``listVolumes``, you can use
the Python built-in ``help`` function::

   >>> help(sxclient.listVolumes)

or ``pydoc`` while in the shell::
   
   $ pydoc sxclient.listVolumes
