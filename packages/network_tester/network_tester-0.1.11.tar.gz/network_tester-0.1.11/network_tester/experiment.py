    An experiment consists of a fixed set of 'vertices'
    (:py:meth:`.new_vertex`) connected together by 'nets'
    (:py:meth:`.new_net`). Vertices correspond with SpiNNaker application cores
    running artificial traffic generators and the nets correspond with traffic
    flows between cores.

    An experiment is broken up into 'groups' (:py:meth:`.new_group`), during
    which the traffic generators produce packets according to a specified
    traffic pattern. Within each group, metrics, such as packet counts, may be
    recorded. Though the placement of vertices and the routing of nets is
    fixed throughout an experiment, the rate and pattern with which which
    packets are produced can be varied between groups allowing, for example,
    different traffic patterns to be tested.

    When the experiment is :py:meth:`.run`, appropriately-configured traffic
    generator applications will be loaded onto SpiNNaker and, after the
    experiment completes, the results are read back ready for analysis.

        Following placement, the experimental parameters are loaded onto the

        ignore_deadline_errors : bool
            If True, any realtime deadline-missed errors will no longer cause
            this method to raise an exception. Other errors will still cause an
            exception to be raised.

            :py:class:`Experiment` object as its argument. The function may
            block to postpone the loading process as required.
        before_group : function or None
            If not None, this function is called before each experimental group

            If not None, this function is called after all experimental groups

        Raises
        ------
        NetworkTesterError
            A :py:exc:`NetworkTesterError` is raised if any vertices reported
            an error. The most common error is likely to be a 'deadline missed'
            error as a result of the experimental timestep being too short or
            the load on some vertices too high in extreme circumstances. Other
            types of error indicate far more severe problems.

            ``results`` attribute of the exception. See the :py:class:`Results`

        If extra control is required over placement and routing of vertices and
        nets in an experiment, this method allows additional constraints and
        custom placement, allocation and routing options and algorithms to be
        used.

        The result of placement, allocation and routing can be found in
        :py:attr:`placements`, :py:attr:`allocations` and  :py:attr:`routes`
        respectively.

        If even greater control is required, :py:attr:`placements`,
        :py:attr:`allocations` and  :py:attr:`routes` may be set explicitly.
        Once these attributes have been set, this method will not alter them.

        Since many applications will not care strongly about placement,
