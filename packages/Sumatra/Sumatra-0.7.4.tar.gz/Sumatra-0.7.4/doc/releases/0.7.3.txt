Sumatra 0.7.3 release notes
===========================

*September 3rd 2015*

Sumatra 0.7.3 is a bug-fix release. It fixes the following bugs:

* `issue 274`_: "Download button does not download file."
* `issue 278`_: "Using --addlabel=parameters raises TypeError."
* `issue 280`_: "Input not shown in dataview (web interface)."

In addition:

* If the "reason" and "comment" fields are formatted as reStructuredText they are correctly
  rendered in the list view (as well as in the detail view).
* Browsers (except Safari and IE) get a sensible filename when downloading data files.
* Fixed a failure to find input data files when the datastore root is not set to the working directory.
