Description: plone4.csrffixes
        ================
        
        The package aims to backport the auto CSRF implementation from Plone 5
        to Plone 4.
        
        The reason this is necessary is because there are a lot of CSRF problem
        with the ZMI that Zope2 will never be able to fix.
        
        See https://plone.org/products/plone/security/advisories/security-vulnerability-20151006-csrf
        for more details.
        
        
        Installation
        ============
        
        
        Plone 4.3, 4.2, 4.1 and 4.0
        ---------------------------
        
        add `plone4.csrffixes` to eggs list::
        
            eggs =
                ...
                plone4.csrffixes
                ...
        
        
        add a new version pin for plone.protect, plone.keyring and plone.locking::
        
            [versions]
            ...
            plone.protect = 3.0.12
            plone.keyring = 3.0.1
            plone.locking = 2.0.8
            ...
        
        
        Plone 4.0 and 4.1
        -----------------
        
        If lxml is not already included in your site, this package has a dependency
        on lxml and will pull it in when installed.
        
        We recommend pinning to version 2.3.6 of lxml. If you use a version of lxml > 3,
        you'll need to also install the `cssselect` package.
