# The-Big-Username-Blacklist-Python

This library lets you validate usernames against a blacklist. The blacklist data is based on the data from [The-Big-Username-Blacklist](https://github.com/marteinn/The-Big-Username-Blacklist) and contains privilege, programming terms, section names, financial terms and actions.


## How it works

the_big_username_blacklist exposes a function named validate, you can use that function to see if a word is occuring in the blacklist.

## Usage

Validating a username is easy, if the word is in the blacklist, return False (validation failed), otherwise True. Example:

```python
>>>> from the_big_username_blacklist import validate
>>>> validate("root")
False
>>>> validate("martin")
True

```

## Installation
