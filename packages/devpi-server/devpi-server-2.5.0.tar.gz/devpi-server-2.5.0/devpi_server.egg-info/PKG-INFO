        consistent robust pypi-cache
        ----------------------------------------
        
        You can point ``pip or easy_install`` to the ``root/pypi/+simple/``
        index, serving as a self-updating transparent cache for pypi-hosted
        **and** external packages.  Cache-invalidation uses the latest and
        greatest PyPI protocols.  The cache index continues to serve when
        offline and will resume cache-updates once network is available.
        
        github-style indexes
        ---------------------------------
        
        Each user can have multiple indexes and upload packages and docs via
        standard ``setup.py`` invocations.  Users, indexes (and soon projects
        and releases) are manipulaed through a RESTful HTTP API.
        
        index inheritance
        --------------------------
        
        Each index can be configured to merge in other indexes so that it serves
        both its uploads and all releases from other index(es).  For example, an
        index using ``root/pypi`` as a parent is a good place to test out a
        release candidate before you push it to PyPI.
        
        good defaults and easy deployment
        ---------------------------------------
        
        Get started easily and create a permanent devpi-server deployment
        including pre-configured templates for ``nginx`` and cron. 
        
        separate tool for Packaging/Testing activities
        -------------------------------------------------------
        
        The complimentary `devpi-client <http://pypi.python.org/devpi-client>`_ tool
        helps to manage users, indexes, logins and typical setup.py-based upload and
        installation workflows.
        
        See http://doc.devpi.net for getting started and documentation.
        
        
        
        Changelog
        =========
        
        2.5.0 (2015-11-19)
        ------------------
        
        - fix a regression of 2.3.0 which would cause many write-transactions
          for mirrored simple-page entries that didn't change.  Previous to the fix,
          accesses to mirrored simple pages will result in a new
          write-transaction every 30 minutes if the page is accessed which
          is likely on a somewhat busy site.  If you running with replicas
          it is recommended to do an an export/import cycle to remove all 
          the unneccessary writes that were produced since devpi-server-2.3.0.
          They delay the setup of new replicas considerably.
        
        - add info about pypi_whitelist on simple page when root/pypi is blocked for
          a project.
        
        - replica simple-page serving will not unneccessarily wait for new 
          simple-page entries to arrive at the replication side if the master 
          does not return any changes in the initial simple-page request.
          Previously a replica would wait for the replication-thread to catch
          up even if no links changed.
        
        - fix setup.py to work on py34 and with LANG="C" environments.
          Thanks Jason R. Coombs.
        
        - fix issue284: allow users who are listed in acl_upload to delete packages
        
        
        2.4.0 (2015-11-11)
        ------------------
        
        - NOTE: devpi-server-2.4 is compatible to data from devpi-server-2.3 but
          not the other way round.  Once you run devpi-server-2.4 you can not go
          back. It's always a good idea to make a backup before trying a new version :)
        
        - NOTE: if you use ``--logger-cfg`` with .yaml files you will need to
          install pyyaml yourself as devpi-server-2.4 dropped it as a direct
          dependency as it does not install for win32/python3.5 and is 
          not needed for devpi-server operations except for logging configuration.
          Specifying a ``*.json`` file always works.
        
        - add timeout to replica requests
        
        - fix issue275: improve error message when a serverdir exists but has no
          version
        
        - improve testing mechanics and name normalization related to storing doczips
        
        - refine keyfs to provide lazy deep readonly-views for
          dict/set/list/tuple types by default.  This introduces safety because
          users (including plugins) of keyfs-values can only write/modify a value
          by explicitly getting it with readonly=False (thereby deep copying it)
          and setting it with the transaction.  It also allows to avoid unnecessary
          copy-operations when just reading values.
        
        - fix issue283: pypi cache didn't work for replicas.
        
        - performance improvements for simple pages with lots of releases.
          this also changed the db layout of the caching from pypi.python.org mirrors
          but will seamlessly work on older data, see NOTE at top.
        
        - add "--profile-requests=NUM" option which turns on per-request
          profiling and will print out after NUM requests are executed
          and then restart profiling.
        
        - fix tests for pypy. We officially support pypy now.
        
        
        2.3.1 (2015-09-14)
        ------------------
        
        - fix issue272: require devpi-common >= 2.0.6
        
        - recognize newly registered PyPI projects, now that we don't watch the
          PyPI changelog anymore
        
        
        2.3.0 (2015-09-10)
        ------------------
        
        - switched to semantic versioning. Only major revisions will ever require an
          export/import cycle.
        
        - fix issue260: Log identical upload message on level "info"
        
        - Log upload trigger message on level "warn"
        
        - The PyPI changelog isn't watched for changes anymore.
          Instead we cache release data for 30 minutes, this can be adjusted with the
          ``--mirror-cache-expiry`` option.
        
        - fix issue251: Require and validate the "X-DEVPI-SERIAL" from master in
          replica thread
        
        - fix issue258: fix FileReplicationError representation for proper logging
        
        - fix issue256: if a project removes all releases from pypi or the project is
          deleted on pypi, we get a 404 back. In that case we now return an empty list
          of releases instead of returning an UpstreamError.
        
        - Change nginx template to serve HEAD in addition to GET requests of files
          directly instead of proxying to devpi-server
        
        - make keyfs cache size configurable via "--keyfs-cache-size" option and
          increase the default size to improve performance for installations with many
          writes
        
        
        2.2.2 (2015-07-09)
        ------------------
        
        - make replica thread more robust by catching more exceptions
        
        - Remove duplicates in plugin version info
        
        - track timestamps for event processing and replication and expose in /+status
        
        - implement devpiweb_get_status_info hook for devpi-web >= 2.4.0 status messages
        
        - UPGRADE NOTE: if devpi-web is installed, you have to request
          ``application/json`` for ``/+status``, or you might get a html page.
        
        - address issue246: refuse uploading release files if they do not
          contain the version that was transferred with the metadata of
          the upload request.
        
        - fix issue248: prevent change of index type after creation
