quintagroup.theme.sunrain Installation
=======================

*  When you're reading this you have probably already run
   ``easy_install quintagroup.theme.sunrain``. Find out how to install setuptools
   (and EasyInstall) here:
   http://peak.telecommunity.com/DevCenter/EasyInstall

* Get `pythonproducts`_ and install it via::

       python setup.py install --home /path/to/instance

  into your Zope instance.

*  Create a file called ``quintagroup.theme.sunrain-configure.zcml`` in the
   ``/path/to/instance/etc/package-includes`` directory.  The file
   should only contain this::

       <include package="quintagroup.theme.sunrain" />

.. _pythonproducts: http://plone.org/products/pythonproducts

Alternatively, if you are using **zc.buildout** and the **plone.recipe.zope2instance**
recipe to manage your project, you can do this:

* Add ``quintagroup.theme.sunrain`` to the list of eggs to install, e.g.::

    [buildout]
    ...
    eggs =
       ...
       quintagroup.theme.sunrain

* Tell the plone.recipe.zope2instance recipe to install a ZCML slug::

    [instance]
    recipe = plone.recipe.zope2instance
    ...
    zcml =
       quintagroup.theme.sunrain

* The newest releases are suitable for **Plone 5**. If you want to use it with **Plone 4**, please pin themeâ€™s version - **6.x** (according to the latest release before 7.0 - e.g. 6.6)::

    [versions]
    quintagroup.theme.sunrain = 6.6

For 6.x version details see https://github.com/quintagroup/quintagroup.theme.sunrain/releases.

* Re-run buildout, e.g. with::

    $ ./bin/buildout

You can skip the ZCML slug if you are going to explicitly include the package
from another package's configure.zcml file.
