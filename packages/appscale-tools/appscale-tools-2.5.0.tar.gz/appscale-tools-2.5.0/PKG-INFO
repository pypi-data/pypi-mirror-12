        AppScale is a platform that allows users to deploy and host their 
        own Google App Engine applications. It executes automatically over 
        Amazon EC2, Google Compute Engine, Digital Ocean,
        Rackspace, Eucalyptus, CloudStack,
        OpenStack, as well as Xen, VirtualBox, VMWare, and KVM. It has been
        developed and is maintained by AppScale Systems, Inc., in Santa
        Barbara, CA.
        
        ## AppScale Tools ##
        AppScale Tools Version 2.5.0
        from AppScale Systems, Inc.
        http://www.appscale.com
        
        This toolset automates the installation and manipulation of
        the AppScale system. AppScale can be run as a cloud over 
        Eucalyptus, EC2, or Google Compute Engine, over a virtualization
        layer such as Xen or KVM, or directly on a non-virtualized cluster.
        
        To install the tools run for debian and osx:
        
        sudo bash debian/appscale_build.sh
        
        or 
        
        sudo bash osx/appscale_install.sh
        
        This will remove any directories /usr/local/appscale-tools*
        and install the tools in /usr/local/appscale-tools.
