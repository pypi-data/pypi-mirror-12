    # MAX_WAIT_TIME seconds. I will disconnect if you send data before the
    # "ok\n". All data you get after the "ok\n" will be from the other side.

    # submitted a matching token. The token is the same for each side.

    # matching connections were established. A future API will reveal these
    # limits to clients instead of causing mysterious spontaneous failures.

    # connections, applications will not receive any data after half-closing
    # their outgoing side). Applications must negotiate shutdown with their
