mara.contrib
============

The ``contrib`` module contains functionality which isn't used by the core of
Mara, but which can be useful when building your own services.


.. _class_contrib_commands:

``mara.contrib.commands``
=========================

This provides a ``Receive`` handler for parsing commands, a command registry,
and a decorator to register command functions.

Example usage::

    # Create a command registry
    # This will add its own Receive handler
    from mara.contrib.commands import CommandRegistry, cmd_commands, cmd_help
    commands = CommandRegistry(service)
    
    # Register the ``commands`` command, to list registered commands
    commands.register('commands', cmd_commands)
    
    # Register the ``help`` command, to show help for registered commands
    # The extra context tells help what we've registered cmd_commands as
    commands.register('help', cmd_help, extra={'cmd_commands': 'commands'})
    
    # Start registering commands
    @commands.register('look')
    def cmd_look(event):
        client = event.client
        client.write('You look around')
        service.write_all('%s looks around' % client.username, exclude=client)

If a command suffers an exception, it will be logged to the ``command`` log
level, and if ``settings.commands_debug`` is ``True``, it will also be sent
to the client who entered the command.


Registering commands
--------------------

Register a command with the ``CommandRegistry.register`` method::

    @commands.register
    def help(event):
        'Triggered when user sends "help" with no arguments'
    
    @commands.register('look', args=r'(.*)', group='room'):
    def cmd_look(event, *args, **kwargs):
        'Triggered when user sends "look" with matching arguments'

Commands written outside the scope of the command registry (and before their
name is known) can have their parameters pre-defined with the
``@define_command`` decorator::

    from mara.contrib.commands import define_command
    @define_command(args=r'(.*)')
    def dance(event, desc):
        ...
    
    # Register dance() as "prance" command
    commands.register('prance', dance)
    
    # Register dance() as "dance" command (take name of fn name)
    commands.register(dance)

This technique is used by other ``contrib`` modules, and can be useful when
defining your own re-usable modules.

The exact arguments for the ``register`` method depend on which class of
``Command`` you're using, but the default ``Command`` accepts the following
keyword arguments:

``args``
    Optional regular expression to match arguments (case insensitive)
``syntax``
    Optional human-readable syntax
``group``
    Optional command group
``help``
    Optional help; if missing, will be taken from docstring
``can``
    Optional callback to determine command availability.
    It is passed the event, and if it returns True, the
    command can be used. If not set, it can always be used.
``context``
    Optional object to set as CommandEvent.context


Command functions
-----------------

Command functions are passed the following arguments:

``event``
    A ``CommandEvent`` based on the ``Receive`` event, (ie
    containing its ``service``, ``client`` etc), plus:
    
    ``event.cmd``
        The command name which was matched for this command
    ``event.registry``
        The command registry this command is registered with
``*args``
    A list of values of unnamed groups in the ``args`` regex
``**kwargs``
    A dict of values of named groups in the ``args`` regex

If a keyword argument's value is None, it will not be passed to the function.


Subclassing the ``CommandRegistry``
-----------------------------------

By default ``CommandRegistry.parse`` splits received data into command and data
on the first space. This is the basis of a command syntax for talkers and muds.

You can change this behaviour by subclassing the registry and implementing your
own ``parse`` method. It receives the ``Receive`` event, and should return a
tuple of ``(command_name, command_raw_args)``, or raise a ``ValueError`` if the
command is not found or not available.


.. _class_contrib_commands_socials:

``mara.contrib.commands.socials``
=================================

Social commands. These require a :ref:`user store <class_contrib_users>`, and
work best if the user store has the :ref:`gender <class_contrib_users_gender>`
extension on the ``.gender`` attribute.

To add the default socials, call ``gen_social_cmds`` with the service,
commands handler and user store::

    gen_social_cmds(service, commands, User)

This module uses :ref:`class_contrib_language`` to get its list of social verbs
and to perform basic natural language processing to conjugate verbs and convert
usernames and pronouns.


.. _class_contrib_users:

``mara.contrib.users``
======================

User account management.

Create a user store by subclassing ``BaseUser``::

    from mara.contrib.users import BaseUser
    class User(BaseUser):
        service = service

Add the client's related ``user`` to ``Client`` events by binding
``event_add_user``. This must be done before any other event handlers for
``Client`` events::

    from mara import events
    from mara.contrib.users import event_add_user
    service.listen(events.Client, event_add_user)

Add a client serialiser so that the user object can be restored after a
restart::

    from mara.contrib.users import BaseUserSerialiser
    class UserSerialiser(BaseUserSerialiser):
        service = service
        store_name = 'user'
        attr = 'user'

Add a command to list all users::

    from mara.contrib.users import cmd_list_users
    commands.register('users', cmd_list_users, context={'User': User})


.. _class_contrib_users_password:

``mara.contrib.users.password``
===============================

Store passwords using salted bcrypt.

Requires the ``bcrypt`` module::

    pip install bcrypt

Add the password mixin to your user store::

    from mara.contrib.users.password import PasswordMixin
    class User(PasswordMixin, BaseUser):
        service = service

This adds a new encrypted ``password`` field to the user store, and two new
methods:

``set_password(pass)``
    Encrypt the password and store it on the object
``check_password(pass)``
    Check the password against the one stored


.. _class_contrib_users_admin:

``mara.contrib.users.admin``
============================

Mark users as admins. This will normally be used in conjunction with the
:ref:`passwords <class_contrib_users_password>` user extension.

Add the admin mixin to your user store::

    from mara.contrib.users.gender import AdminMixin
    class User(AdminMixin, BaseUser):
        service = service

There is a command availability helper, ``if_admin``, which can be used with
the ``can`` command definition attribute::

    commands.register('restart', cmd_restart, can=if_admin)

There are two commands available, one to list admin users, and another to set
or unset admin users::

    from mara.contrib.users.admin import cmd_list_admin, cmd_set_admin
    commands.register('admin', cmd_list_admin, context={'User': User})
    commands.register(
        'set_admin', cmd_set_admin, context={'User': User}, can=if_admin,
    )

.. _class_contrib_users_gender:

``mara.contrib.users.gender``
=============================

Store a user's gender, to generate accurate pronouns.

Add the gender mixin to your user store::

    from mara.contrib.users.gender import GenderMixin
    class User(GenderMixin, BaseUser):
        service = service

This adds a new ``gender`` field to the user store, which returns a ``Gender``
object with the following attributes:

``type``
    A string set to one of ``'male'``, ``'female'`` or ``'other'``.
    These are available as constants on the class, as
    ``MALE``, ``FEMALE`` and ``OTHER``. Default is ``OTHER``.
    
``subject``
    Pronoun for the subject (he, she or they)
    
``object``
    Pronoun for the object (him, her, they)
    
``possessive``
    Possessive pronoun (his, her, their)
    
``self``
    Referring to oneself (himself, herself, themselves)

There is also a command to check or set gender::

    from mara.contrib.users.gender import cmd_gender
    commands.register('gender', cmd_gender)


.. _class_contrib_language:

``mara.contrib.language``
=========================

Provide natural language processing utils for processing and manipulating
English sentences.

This is an area which has room for improvement.
Natural language processing is a complex topic, and this isn't a comprehensive
solution - stupid things are almost certain to happen. When something does,
please let me know (tweet `@radiac <https://twitter.com/radiac>`_ or add a bug
to github), or better yet, :doc:`contribute a test or fix <../contributing>`.

This is used by :ref:`class_contrib_commands_socials` to modify social actions.


.. _class_contrib_rooms:

``mara.contrib.rooms``
======================

This provides a ``Room`` store for keeping track of ``User`` objects.

It extends the ``User`` store with a ``room`` field.
