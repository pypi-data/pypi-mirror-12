Installation
============

Simply copy the appropriate files (``openscad_dxf.inx`` and the ``openscad_dxf`` folder)
to the installation directory. Install to your Inkscape global installation's ``extensions``
directory or to your local user's inkscape extensions directory. The per platform
installation directories can be found below. If you have ``pip`` and want to try an
even easier (but experimental) installation method you can try using
``pip install --target=<installation_dir> inkscape-openscad-dxf``. If you do use
this method, do not use a ``~`` to refer to your home directory. Some versions of
``pip`` will misinterpret it and create a directory called ``~`` in the current
directory.
