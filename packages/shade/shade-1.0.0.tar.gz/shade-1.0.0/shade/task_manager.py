    Some consumers need to inject things like rate-limiting or auditing
    around each external REST interaction. Task provides an interface
    to encapsulate each such interaction. Also, although shade itself
    operates normally in a single-threaded direct action manner, consuming
    programs may provide a multi-threaded TaskManager themselves. For that
    reason, Task uses threading events to ensure appropriate wait conditions.
    These should be a no-op in single-threaded applications.

    A consumer is expected to overload the main method.

                    the main payload at execution time.
