Description: ==========================================
        This is the Evidential Tool Bus (ETB) v0.2
        ==========================================
        
        The Evidential Tool Bus provides 
        
        See the file INSTALL for installation instruction, in particular
        external dependencies required to get ETB running.
        
        The demos/ directory contains demos of ETB: 
        
            - allsat/ implements an ALLSAT solver using the ETB on top of the
              yices SMT solver.
        
            - allsat2/ implements an ALLSAT solver using the ETB on top of the
              yices2 SMT solver.
          
            - make/ shows how to use the ETB to implement a distributed make
              tools that keeps track of all dependencies between source and
              objects files.
        
            - k-induction/ shows two ways to implement a simple k-induction
              procedure on top of the ETB. It shows how derivation rules can
              be used to establish a fact, and inference rules can be used
              to extract a proof of that fact.
        
            - hybridSal/ shows how to integrate separate tools in a 
              complete workflow.
        
            - vc/ shows a demo of a wrapper that dynamically creates lemmata (generated clauses)
        
            - blackwhite/ shows a demo of the pure Datalog with recursion but without any wrappers
        
        doc contains the documentation, including reference manuals
        
        src contains the source code (see the README there for more details)
        
        tests contains test scripts
