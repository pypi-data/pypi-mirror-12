Description: A thread pool is an object that maintains a pool of worker threads to perform
        time consuming operations in parallel. It assigns jobs to the threads
        by putting them in a work request queue, where they are picked up by the
        next available thread. This then performs the requested operation in the
        background and puts the results in a another queue.
        
        The thread pool object can then collect the results from all threads from
        this queue as soon as they become available or after all threads have
        finished their work. It's also possible, to define callbacks to handle
        each result as it comes in.
