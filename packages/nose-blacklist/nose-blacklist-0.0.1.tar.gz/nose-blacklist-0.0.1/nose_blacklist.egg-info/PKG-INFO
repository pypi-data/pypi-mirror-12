         nose-blacklist
        ================
        
        nose-blacklist is a plugin for nose_ that provides a powerful way of skipping
        tests without requiring code changes.
        
        - Test cases are excluded by regex matching
        - Tests cases are matched by their fully-qualified names, including the module,
          class, and function/method names.
        - Tests to skip can be sourced from one or more files, or from cli arguments
        
        
        Quickstart
        ==========
        
        .. code-block:: shell
        
            $ pip install nose-blacklist
        
            $ nosetests --with-blacklist \
                --blacklist=<pattern1> \
                --blacklist=<pattern2> \
                mytests/
        
        Blacklist strings can be specified from one or more files. Blacklist files can
        be used in conjunction with the ``--blacklist`` arguments.
        
        .. code-block:: shell
        
            $ cat blacklist.txt
            test_thing
            # test_other_thing
            test_third_thing
        
            $ nosetests --with-blacklist \
                --blacklist-file=blacklist.txt \
                mytests/
        
        The blacklist file should have a single pattern per line, as above. Any line
        starting with a ``#`` is commented and will be ignored.
