        GuessIt is a python library that extracts as much information as possible from a video filename.
        
        It has a very powerful matcher that allows to guess a lot of metadata from a video using its filename only.
        This matcher works with both movies and tv shows episodes.
        
        For example, GuessIt can do the following::
        
            $ guessit "Treme.1x03.Right.Place,.Wrong.Time.HDTV.XviD-NoTV.avi"
            For: Treme.1x03.Right.Place,.Wrong.Time.HDTV.XviD-NoTV.avi
            GuessIt found: {
                "title": "Treme",
                "season": 1,
                "episode": 3,
                "episode_title": "Right Place, Wrong Time",
                "format": "HDTV",
                "video_codec": "XviD",
                "release_group": "NoTV",
                "container": "avi",
                "mimetype": "video/x-msvideo",
                "type": "episode"
            }
        
        Important note
        --------------
        GuessIt 2 has been rewriten from scratch and is currently in Beta. GuessIt is now a release name parser only, and
        support for additional features like hashes computations has been dropped.
        
        To migrate from guessit ``0.x`` or ``1.x``, please read
        `MIGRATION.rst <https://github.com/wackou/guessit/blob/2.x/MIGRATION.rst>`_.
        
        Previous version of GuessIt is still available in ``1.x`` branch and using ``pip install guessit<2``, but won't be
        maintained anymore.
        
        Install
        -------
        
        Installing GuessIt is simple with `pip <http://www.pip-installer.org/>`_::
        
            $ pip install guessit
        
        Filename matcher
        ----------------
        
        The filename matcher is based on `Rebulk <https://www.github.com/Toilal/rebulk>`_ and is able to recognize many
        properties from the filename. Guessed values are cleaned up and given in a readable format which may not match
        exactly the raw filename.
        
        Usage
        -----
        
        guessit can be use from command line::
        
            $ guessit
            usage: guessit [-h] [-t TYPE] [-n] [-Y] [-D] [-L ALLOWED_LANGUAGES]
                           [-C ALLOWED_COUNTRIES] [-E] [-T EXPECTED_TITLE] [-f INPUT_FILE]
                           [-v] [-P SHOW_PROPERTY] [-a] [-j] [-y] [-p] [-V] [--version]
                           [filename [filename ...]]
        
            positional arguments:
              filename              Filename or release name to guess
        
            optional arguments:
              -h, --help            show this help message and exit
        
            Naming:
              -t TYPE, --type TYPE  The suggested file type: movie, episode. If undefined,
                                    type will be guessed.
              -n, --name-only       Parse files as name only, considering "/" and "\" like
                                    other separators.
              -Y, --date-year-first
                                    If short date is found, consider the first digits as
                                    the year.
              -D, --date-day-first  If short date is found, consider the second digits as
                                    the day.
              -L ALLOWED_LANGUAGES, --allowed-languages ALLOWED_LANGUAGES
                                    Allowed language (can be used multiple times)

              -E, --episode-prefer-number
                                    Guess "serie.213.avi" as the episode 213. Without this
                                    option, it will be guessed as season 2, episode 13
              -T EXPECTED_TITLE, --expected-title EXPECTED_TITLE
                                    Expected title to parse (can be used multiple times)
        
            Input:
              -f INPUT_FILE, --input-file INPUT_FILE
                                    Read filenames from an input text file. File should
                                    use UTF-8 charset.
        
            Output:
              -v, --verbose         Display debug output
              -P SHOW_PROPERTY, --show-property SHOW_PROPERTY
                                    Display the value of a single property (title, series,
                                    video_codec, year, ...)
              -a, --advanced        Display advanced information for filename guesses, as
                                    json output
              -j, --json            Display information for filename guesses as json
                                    output
              -y, --yaml            Display information for filename guesses as yaml
                                    output
        
            Information:
              -p, --properties      Display properties that can be guessed.
              -V, --values          Display property values that can be guessed.
              --version             Display the guessit version.
        
        It can also be used as a python module::
        
            >>> from guessit import guessit
            >>> guessit(u'Treme.1x03.Right.Place,.Wrong.Time.HDTV.XviD-NoTV.avi')  # doctest: +ALLOW_UNICODE
            MatchesDict([('title', 'Treme'), ('season', 1), ('episode', 3), ('episode_title', 'Right Place, Wrong Time'), ('format', 'HDTV'), ('video_codec', 'XviD'), ('release_group', 'NoTV'), ('container', 'avi'), ('mimetype', 'video/x-msvideo'), ('type', 'episode')])
        
        ``MatchesDict`` is a dict that keeps matches ordering.
        
        Command line options can be given as dict or string to the second argument.
        
        GuessIt only accept unicode string, so you need to use ``u`` prefix for input string on python 2.
