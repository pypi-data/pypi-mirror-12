Description: A Python based library for accessing the Science Logic EM7 RESTful API
        ======================================================================
        
        The goal of this project is to build out an easy to use Python based library to interacte with
        a ScienceLogic API server. I will be attempting to replicate everything in the feature list below.
        
        Dependencies:
          - `Requests <https://pypi.python.org/pypi/requests>`_
          - `Requests Mock <https://pypi.python.org/pypi/requests-mock>`_
        
        .. Warning::
          This project is in no way assosiated with ScienceLogic!
        
        .. Warning::
          This has not yet been completed and should not be used in production!
