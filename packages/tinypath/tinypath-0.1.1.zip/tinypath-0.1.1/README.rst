tinypath
========

Tinypath is a tiny file path module that provides only the most crucial
and commonly needed functionality, including turning files and folders
into classes. Designed as a companion module for projects that require
handling arbitrary paths from users without breaking, and easy
navigation of local file systems.

By staying tiny in both size and functionality, the API is easy to learn
so you can start using it right away. Essentially, it provides
object-oriented access to files and folders with several convenient
attributes such as checking file or folder size, handling a lot of the
intricacies of os.path behind the scene so you do not have to.
