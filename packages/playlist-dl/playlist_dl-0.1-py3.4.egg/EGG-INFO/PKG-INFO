Description: # playlist-dl
        
        Youtube playlist downloader. Based on the majestic [youtube-dl](http://youtube-dl.org/)
        
        
        ### Features
        
        * Resumable downloading
        * Video resolution, video format, audio bitrate, audio format can be configured
        * Video Output format (via conversion) can also be specified
        
        
        ### Installation
        
        Python 3 only.  
        Get it from pip
        ```
        pip install playlist-dl
        ```
        
        or download the zip and execute the following
        ```
        python setup.py install
        ```
        
        
        ### Tutorial
        
        * To start a new playlist download, create a new folder and open terminal (cmd) in it.
        * Then run `playlist-dl`
        * Give the playlist link and playlist-dl (actually youtube-dl) will start scanning the playlist.
        * After that it will create a config.json file in that folder. Edit that if needed.
        * Videos will start downloading one by one.
        * You can close the terminal any time. Reopening the terminal in that folder and running `playlist-dl` will resume the downloads.
        
        
        ### Config.json
        
        * `start` - The item in playlist from where the download will be started.
        * `end` - The item in playlist till where downloading will be done.
        * `output_format` - The format to convert the downloaded video to. (eg > mkv,mp4,flv,webm)
        * `download.resolution` - The height of the video to download. If set to 0, then bestvideo will be downloaded.
        * `download.video_format` - The format of the video stream to download. Note that this is different from `output_format` (eg > flv,webm,mp4).
        * `download.bitrate` - The bitrate of the audio to download. If set to 0, then bestaudio will be downloaded.
        * `download.audio_format` - The format of the audio stream to download. (eg > webm,m4a)
        * `download.more_options` - More download options. See [youtube-dl README](https://github.com/rg3/youtube-dl/blob/master/README.md) for the complete list.
        
        **NOTE** - If the program finds no match with your `download.` audio/video settings, then it will automatically settle with the most preferable audio/video options. So if you leave `video_format` blank and just specify resolution, it will look in all formats for that resolution. Therefore it is recommended to specify `output_format` for consistency.
        
        
        ##### Example of a config.json
        
        ```json
        {
            "start": 37,
            "output_format": "mkv",
