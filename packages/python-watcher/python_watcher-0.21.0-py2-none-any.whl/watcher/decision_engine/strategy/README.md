Sercon: Server Consolidation Algorithm using Live Migration of Virtual Machines for Green Computing 
Virtualization technologies changed the way data centers of enterprises utilize their server resources.
 
Instead of using dedicated servers for each type of application, virtualization allows viewing resources as a pool of
unified resources, thereby reducing complexity and easing manageability.
 
Server consolidation technique,which deals with reducing the number of servers used by consolidating applications, is one of the main
applications of virtualization in data centers.
The latter technique helps to use computing resources more effectively and has many benefits,such as reducing costs of power, cooling and, hence, contributes to the
Green IT initiative. 
In a dynamic data center environment, where applications encapsulated as virtual machines
are mapped to and released from the nodes frequently, reducing the number of server nodes used can be
achieved by migrating applications without stopping their services, the technology known as live migration.

However, live migration is a costly operation; hence, how to perform periodic server consolidation operation
in a migration-aware way is a challenging task. 
Sercon not only minimizes the overall number of used servers, but also minimizes the number of migrations.
