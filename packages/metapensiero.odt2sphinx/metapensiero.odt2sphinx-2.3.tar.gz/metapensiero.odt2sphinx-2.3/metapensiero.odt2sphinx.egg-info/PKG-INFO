        ==========
        
        What is it ?
        ------------
        
        Odt2sphinx converts OpenDocument Text file(s) to one or several .rst files.
        
        This is a fork of Christophe de Vienne `odt2sphinx`__.

        -------

            pip install metapensiero.odt2sphinx
        
        
        Usage
        -----
        
        ::
        
            usage: odt2sphinx [-h] [--debug] [--download-source-link]
                              [--encoding ENCODING] [--test]
                              source [target]
        
            ODT to RST
        
            positional arguments:
              source                Source ODT file to be converted, or a directory
                                    containing ODT files and corresponding .expected.rst
                                    files in test mode
              target                Either destination directory, a single .rst target
                                    filename or "-" for stdout
        
            optional arguments:
              -h, --help            show this help message and exit
              --debug               Emit debug noise
              --download-source-link
                                    Add a link to the ODT source file
              --encoding ENCODING   Output encoding, by default UTF-8
              --test                Run in test mode, comparing output with expected reST
                                    to be found in “source.expected.rst”
        
        Output files
        ------------
        
        There are three modes of operation:
        
        1. Sphinx, splitting the source in multiple files, one per chapter
        2. Monolithic single plain reST output
        3. Stdout
        4. Functional test
        
        The first mode is selected by omitting the second positional argument, or giving it the name of
        a directory. The second is selected by specifying a file name with a ``.rst`` extension as the
        second positional argument. The third by specifying ``-`` as the target name. The latter by
        using the ``--test`` option.
        
        Multiple files mode
        ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
        
        The files are generated in the target dir, which by default has the same name as the .odt file
        minus the extension.
        
        At least one file, ``index.rst``, will be written. Depending on the document content,
        additional rst files may be generated.
        
        Images are extracted and put together in an "images" directory inside the targetdir.
        
        Monolithic output mode
        ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
        
        All the output goes into the single rst file specified as the second positional argument.
        
        Images are extracted and put together in an "images" directory inside the directory containing
        the output file.
        
        Functional test mode
        ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
        
        This mode is used by the automatic tests: when the ``--test`` option is specified, the tool
        loads the *expected* result from a file with the same name as the *source* one but with the
        ``.odt`` suffix replaced by ``.expected.rst``.
        
        It will print out any discrepancy as a *unified diff*.
        
        Styles mapping
        --------------
        
        The following rules will be applied to particulary styles when converting an .odt file. The
        style names are case-insensitive.
        
        Title
           Becomes the main document title (over- and underlined with ``=``)
        
        Subtitle
           Becomes the document subtitle (over- and underlined with ``-``)
        
        Title 1 ... Title 6
           Becomes sub-chapter titles, underlined respectively with ``#``, ``=``, ``-``, ``~``, ``+``
           and `````; in `multiple files mode` the source document is splitted on ``Title 1`` sections
           and a reference to the single files is inserted in a ``toctree`` directive in the
           ``index.rst`` file
        
        "Warning" (or "Avertissement")
           The chapter becomes the content of a ``.. warning`` directive
        
        "Tip" (or "Trucs & Astuces")
           The chapter becomes the content of a ``.. tip`` directive
        
        "Note" or "Information"
           The chapter becomes the content of a ``.. note`` directive
