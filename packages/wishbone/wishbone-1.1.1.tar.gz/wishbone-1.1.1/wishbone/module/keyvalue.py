    '''**Adds the requested key values to the event data.**

    Assumes event.data is a Python datastructure to which the requested key
    values can be added. Otherwise event.data is moved to a key name "<body>".

    Existing keys will be overwritten.

    Parameters:

        - body(str)("data")
           |  If event.data is not a dict, replace by dict and copy event.data
           |  into event.data.<body>

        - overwrite(dict)({})
           |  A dict of key/value pairs to overwrite existing keys.

    Queues:

        - inbox
           |  Incoming events.
