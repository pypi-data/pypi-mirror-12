        =============
        
        A proxy for Google Play. Provides you with a way to download your APKs easily,
        and without being tracked by Google.
        
        How to use it?
        ##############
        
        Install it using pip
        ::
        
          $ pip install gplayproxy
        
        Then, run it how you want, for instance with pserve::
        
          $ pserve gplayproxy.ini
        
        In a separate process, you also need to run the worker::
        
          $ rqworker
        
        Then, the only thing you need is an HTTP client to tell the proxy to download
        a package. For instance::
        
          $ http post http://localhost:6543/package/org.thoughtcrime.securesms
