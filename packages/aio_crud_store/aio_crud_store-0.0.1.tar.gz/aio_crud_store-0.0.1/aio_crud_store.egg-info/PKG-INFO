Description: AsyncIO CRUD Store
        ==================
        
        A very simple subset of databases capabilities intended to use most of dbs
        the same way. You can use it to write database independent asyncio
        libraries.
        
        It currently supports mongodb (through [motor]) and postrgresql
        (through [aiopg]), please feel free to add other dbs implementations.
        
        
        Usage
        -----
        The api is very simple and obvious (I hope).
        The working examples are in `examples` directory.
        
            # create
            id = await store.create({'foo': 'bar'})
        
            # read
            doc = await store.read(foo='bar')
        
            # update
            await store.update(id, {'foo': 'baz', 'spam': 1})
        
            # delete
            await store.delete(id)
