*"I love writing BLAST parsers!" -- no one, ever*

dammit is a simple de novo transcriptome annotator. It was born out of the
observation that: annotation is mundane and annoying; all the individual pieces
of the process exist already; and, the existing solutions are overly complicated 
or rely on crappy non-free software. 

Science shouldn't suck for the sake of sucking, so dammit attempts
to make this sucky part of the process suck a little less.

## Miscellany

Calvin and Hobbes is (c) Bill Watterson. I believe the above excerpt qualifies as fair use, but if there are any objections,
I will dejectedly take it down.
