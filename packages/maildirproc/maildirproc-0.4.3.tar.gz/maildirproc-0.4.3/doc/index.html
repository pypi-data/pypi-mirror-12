<h1>maildirproc</h1>

<p>maildirproc is a program that processes one or several existing
mail boxes in the <a
href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Maildir">maildir</a> format. It is
primarily focused on mail sorting &mdash; i.e., moving, copying,
forwarding and deleting mail according to a set of rules. It can be
seen as an alternative to <a
href="http://www.procmail.org">procmail</a>, but instead of being a
delivery agent (which wants to be part of the delivery chain),
maildirproc only processes already delivered mail. And that's a
feature, not a bug.</p>

<p>maildirproc was written by <a href="http://joel.rosdahl.net">Joel
Rosdahl</a> &lt;<a
href="mailto:joel@rosdahl.net">joel@rosdahl.net</a>&gt; and is
distributed under the terms of the <a
href="http://www.gnu.org/licenses/gpl.html">GNU General Public
Licence.</a></p>

<h2>Benefits</h2>

<p>So, what's good about using maildirproc instead of a more
conventional setup, with a delivery agent like procmail? For me (the
author) it's this:</p>

<ul>

<li>It's small. maildirproc is just a small <a
href="http://www.python.org">Python</a> program that is easy to
understand.</li>

<li>It's robust. If there's a syntax error in the configuration, or a
bug that makes the program crash, then nothing happens; the mail will
not disappear. And as a consequence of using maildirs, no locks are
needed.</li>

<li>The configuration language is relatively easy to understand and
use, yet very powerful. The rules are expressed in a full-blown
computer language (<a href="http://www.python.org">Python</a>).</li>

<li>It's easy to test new configuration. Since maildirproc is not part
of the delivery chain, it's just a matter of taking down or disabling
the process, modifying the configuration and running maildirproc in
test mode. When the new configuration is ready, just start or enable
the process again.</li>

</ul>

<h2>Background</h2>

<p>I used <a href="http://www.procmail.org">procmail</a> to sort my
mail for a long time, but I was not entirely happy with its
configuration language. I subscribe to a lot of mailing lists and I
use several e-mail addresses, so the <span
class="command-line">.procmailrc</span> file was quite large and
complex and I found it hard to express mail sorting rules elegantly. I
wanted to be able to define and use functions, data structures, loops
and other imperative language constructs and felt that procmail's
rule-based vocabulary was limiting. I thought about writing a program
to generate the configuration from some higher-level rules, but I
never got to it. I also didn't feel comfortable with e-mail sorting
being part of the delivery chain. (Granted, procmail can be used in
other setups too.)</p>

<p>Then one day I stumbled upon a program called <a
href="http://www.lysator.liu.se/~jc/maildird.html">Maildird</a>,
written by Jörgen Cederlöf, and I liked its basic design:</p>

<div class="quote">
"Maildird calmly waits until the mail is delivered, notices that a new
mail has arrived in the Maildir it monitors, writes something useful
in the log [...] and moves the mail safely to the correct Maildir."
</div>

<p>Since Maildird was not configurable (at least not at the time) in
the way I wanted, I decided to write my own program that worked
somewhat similarly but with a configuration style that suited me. If
you like it, you are welcome to use (or improve) it too.</p>

<h2>Documentation</h2>

<p>See the <a href="reference.html">maildirproc reference</a>.</p>

<h2>Examples</h2>

<p>See the <a href="examples/">examples</a> directory.</p>

<h2>Installation</h2>

<p>maildirproc has no other dependencies than a working <a
href="http://www.python.org">Python</a> 2.5 (or higher) on a Unixish
system. No special installation is needed if you use Python 2.x; just
copy the <span class="command-line">maildirproc</span> file to a
suitable place and run it. The alternative (which must be used if you
use Python 3.x) is to run "python setup.py install".</p>

<p>You can run maildirproc in several diffent ways, e.g.:</p>

<ul>
<li>
Manually: You could, for example, run

<div class="code-example">
maildirproc --once -r foo.rc -b . -m Maildir
</div>

to apply the program in <span class="command-line">foo.rc</span> once on a maildir directory
called <span class="command-line">Maildir</span> in the current directory.
</li>

<li>
By cron: Put a row like

<div class="code-example">
* * * * * maildirproc --once
</div>

in your crontab to run maildirproc each minute (using the default RC
file <span class="command-line">~/.maildirproc/default.rc</span>).
</li>

<li>
As a long-running process: Just start <span
class="command-line">maildirproc</span> (without the <span
class="command-line">--once</span> flag).
</li>

<li>
Using some service supervision framework, for example <a
href="http://smarden.org/runit/">runit</a>.
</li>
</ul>
