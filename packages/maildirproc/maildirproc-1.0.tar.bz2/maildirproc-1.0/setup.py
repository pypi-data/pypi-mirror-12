    several existing mail boxes in the maildir format. It is primarily
    focused on mail sorting -- i.e., moving, copying, forwarding and
    deleting mail according to a set of rules. It can be seen as an
    alternative to procmail, but instead of being a delivery agent
    (which wants to be part of the delivery chain), maildirproc only
    processes already delivered mail. And that's a feature, not a
    bug.""",
