file LICENSE for details).

maildirproc is a program that processes one or several existing mail
boxes in the maildir format. It is primarily focused on mail sorting
-- i.e., moving, copying, forwarding and deleting mail according to a
set of rules. It can be seen as an alternative to procmail, but
instead of being a delivery agent (which wants to be part of the
delivery chain), maildirproc only processes already delivered mail.

For more information, some documentation and examples, see the doc
directory.
