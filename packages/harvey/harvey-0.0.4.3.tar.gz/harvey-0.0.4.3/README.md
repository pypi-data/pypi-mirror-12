## FAQ's

#### How is this any better than [choose a license](http://choosealicense.com/licenses/) and [tldr leagal](https://tldrlegal.com/)?

* Harvey doesn't only let you select a license, it also helps you to add it to your project. So, doing something like:
```bash
harvey apache-2.0 > LICENSE
```
will add the apache license in your project, with your user name, which you have setup in your `git config` settings

* Yes, [choose a license](http://choosealicense.com/licenses/) also allows you to select a license. But since this is a CLI app, you can choose the license without breaking your workflow. Thus, it saves you time by not having to switch over to the browser.

#### Still, it seems really unnecessary

Apart from what I have mentioned above, I wouldn't go as far as saying that harvey is absolutely essential to manage license for your open source project. I felt the need for the app because every time I had to add a license to my project I had to head over to the browser for a license template. So, I created harvey to allow me to add a license without breaking my workflow.
