Description: Eval/Base64 File Scrubber [![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/michigan-com/eval_scrubber.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/michigan-com/eval_scrubber)
        =========================
        
        This script will walk through all files in a directory, find, and remove
        any content that is suspected to be malicious.
        
        This scan uses a regular expression to seek out any potentially malicious content
        
        ```
        infected_pattern = re.compile(r"<\?php\s*eval\((.+\()*base64_decode\(.+\)\).+\s*?>")
        ```
        
        What it is matching is `<?php eval(base64_decode()) ?>` or `<?php eval(gzinflate(base64_decode())) ?>`
        
        It is strongly advized to check that this regular expression will match your needs.
        
        We have not covered all of the edge cases for this script so be warned running this
        script could have negative consequences.
        
        The script accepts two arguments: action and directory
        
        Actions:
        
        * Find - Scans directory recursively and lists all potentially infected files
        * Remove - Scans directory recursively and removes the regular express match
        from all potentially infected files
        
        ```
        python -m eval_scrubber find <dir>
        python -m eval_scrubber remove <dir>
        ```
        
        Set the log level
        ```
        DEBUG=1 python -m eval_scrubber find <dir>
        ```
