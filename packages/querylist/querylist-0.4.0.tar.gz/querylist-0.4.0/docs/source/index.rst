Querylist
=========

Sick of for loop + conditional soup when dealing with complicated lists?
Querylist is here to help.

This package provides a data structure called a QueryList, an extension of
Python's built in list data type that adds django ORM-eseque filtering,
exclusion, and get methods. QueryLists allow developers to easily query and
retrieve data from complex lists without the need for unnecessarily verbose
iteration and selection cruft.

The package also provides BetterDict, a backwards-compatible wrapper for
dictionaries that enables dot lookups and assignment for key values.
