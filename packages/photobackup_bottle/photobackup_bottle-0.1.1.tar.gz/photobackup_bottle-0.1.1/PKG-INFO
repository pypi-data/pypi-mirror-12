Description: #  The Python PhotoBackup server implementation 
        
        The Python3 implementation of PhotoBackup server, made with
        [bottle](http://bottlepy.org/). It follows the
        [official API](https://github.com/PhotoBackup/api/blob/master/api.raml), currently in [version 2](https://github.com/PhotoBackup/api/releases/tag/v2).
        
        ## Installation
        
        Install through [PyPI](https://pypi.python.org/pypi):
        
            pip install photobackup_bottle
        
        Then run the installer, which asks for the directory to save your pictures to
        and the server password:
        
            photobackup init
        
        The script looks for the directory to be writable by the usual `www-data` user.
        It fails gracefully if it is not, just warning you to make it work properly.
        This step creates a `.photobackup` file in the user's home directory,
        containing:
        
        * `BindAddress`, the IP address (default is `127.0.0.1`) ;
        * `MediaRoot`, the directory where the pictures are written in ;
        * `Password`, the SHA-512 hashed password ;
        * `PasswordBcrypt`, a Bcrypt-ed version of your SHA-512 hashed password ;
        * `Port`, the port (default is `8420`).
        
        ## Usage
        
        Launch the server with:
        
            photobackup run
        
        By default, it runs on host `127.0.0.1`, port `8420` and reloads automatically.
        
        ## Production
        
        To put in production, use [Nginx](http://nginx.org/) to bind a sever name to `http://127.0.0.1:8420`.
