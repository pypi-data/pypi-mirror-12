        ====================================
        Mercurial Dynamic Username
        ====================================
        
        Use different commit username per directory tree.
        
        With this extension you may commit as ``John Smith
        <john.smith@serious.com>`` in trees below ``~/work``, and as ``Johny
        <fastjohny@fantasy.net>`` in code lying in ``~/hobby`` - and set this
        rule once, in ``~/.hgrc``.
        
        Example
        =====================
        
        Install the extension (``pip install mercurial_dynamic_username`` or
        manually in the way described below).
        
        Write in your ``~/.hgrc``::
        
            [extensions]
            dynamic_username =
        
            [dynamic_username]
            work.location = ~/work
            work.username = John Smith <john.smith@serious.com>
            hobby.location = ~/hobby ~/blogging
            hobby.username = Johny <fastjohny@fantasy.net>
        
        and just commit. In any repository lying below ``~/work`` you will commit as
        ``John Smith``, in repos below ``~/hobby`` as ``Johny``, elsewhere default
        setting (``username`` from ``[ui]``) will be used.
        
        Configuration syntax
        =====================
        
        All settings are defined in ``[dynamic_username]`` section, and have
        the following form::
        
            «somelabel».location = «list of directory names»
            «somelabel».username = «username used there»
        
        Labels are used only to join those two settings in pairs.
        
        Directory names specified in ``location`` are space or colon separated
        (using standard Mercurial ways of parsing lists in the
        config). Repository match the rule if it lies within directory tree(s)
        specified here. Tildas (``~/..`` and ``~john/...``) are expanded.
        
        Usernames have the same syntax as standard ``username``.
        
        Specifying location without username asks extension to revert to standard
        username, for example::
        
            [ui]
            username = Jake <jake@loose.net>
        
            [dynamic_username]
            work.location = ~/work
            work.username = John Smith <john.smith@serious.com>
            open.location = ~/work/open-source
        
        will commit as ``John Smith`` in ``~/work/libs/veryimportant``, but
        will revert to default ``Jake`` in ``~/work/open-source/libshared``.
        
        Match priority
        ==================================================
        
        If more than one location matches repository, longest one is used
        (like in the ``open-source`` example above). *Longest* is selected
        using actual canonical path after tilda expansion (``~/work/sth`` is
        longer than ``/home/littlejohny/work``).
        
        Dynamic usernames currently always win against ``[ui]``-section
        ``username``, even if the latter is defined in per-repository
        ``.hg/hgrc``. I would gladly give priority to the latter, but I have
        no idea how to detect that without re-parsing configuration.
        
        Testing configuration effects
        ==================================================
        
        You can test effects by callling::
        
            hg showconfig ui.username
        
        (results should vary depending on the repository).
        
        Installation
        =================================================
        
        Recommended way::
        
            pip install mercurial_dynamic_username
        
        (prepend with ``sudo`` if necessary).
        
        Manual way:
        
        - install `mercurial_extension_utils`_
        
        - download ``dynamic_username.py`` from this repository and save it somewhere
        
        - activate extension by::
        
               dynamic_username = /path/to/dynamic_username.py
