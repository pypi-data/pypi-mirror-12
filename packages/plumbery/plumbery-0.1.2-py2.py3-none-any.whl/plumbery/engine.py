class PlumberyEngine:
    """Cloud automation at Dimension Data with Apache Libcloud

    Plumbery is a convenient tool for infrastructure managers at cloud times.
    It allows for easy and repeatable deployments of various
    fittings, including compute nodes and related storage. It allows also for
    quick dismandling of the fittings when required.
    The idea here is not to compete with respected solutions such as chef or
    puppet. At its name implies, plumbery is targeting pipes and fittings, the
    very basic utility stuff that sophisticated tools can leverage.

    :param fileName: the location of the plan for the fittings
    :type fileName: ``str``

    Example::

        from plumbery.engine import PlumberyEngine
        engine = PlumberyEngine('fittings.yaml')
        engine.build_all_blueprints()

    In this example the overall plan, in textual format, is given to the engine
    in preparation of subsequent processing. The software is not trying to guess
    a name by default, so if you do not provide a name, no configuration file
    is loaded. You can load the plan at any stage, or restart the engine
    with an updated plan, by invoking the member function `parse_layout()`

    Note:
        While plumbery is not making assumptions for your configuration files,
        if your infrastructure is simple enough to fit in one single file then
        you are highly encouraged to name it `fittings.yaml`

    Beyond the plan for your fittings, plumbery is also requiring some specific
    credentials to connect to cloud providers. To preserve the confidentiality
    of such information, it is read from the environment, and not from any
    configuration file. Therefore the need for local setup before running
    plumbery. This is part of the installation process.

    Last but not least, plumbery sets the root password of any new server that
    it creates. For obvious security reasons this is not taken from the fittings
    plan but from the environement as well.

    Under Linux, you may want to edit `~/.bash_profile` like this::

        # credentials to access cloud resources from Dimension Data
        export MCP_USERNAME='foo.bar'
        export MCP_PASSWORD='WhatsUpDoc'

        # password to access nodes remotely
        export SHARED_SECRET='*you really want to put a tricky password here*'

    These simple precautions are aiming to protect your infrastructure as much
    as possible. The general goal is to minimize risks induced by exposure to
    your fittings plan. You may lead transformation towards so-called
    infrastructure as code, and for this you will add version control to your
    fittings plan. As a result, plans will be stored in git or equivalent, and
    shared across some people.

    Attributes:
        driver (libcloud.base.NodeDriver):
            A handle to the underlying Apache Libcloud instance

        facilities (list of PlumberyFacility objects):
            Breakdown of the overall plan over multiple facilities. This global
            attribute results from the parsing of the fittings plan.

        safeMode (boolean):
            If True, which is the default, then no actual change
            will be made against the infrastructure. This global attribute
            is coming from the fittings plan.

        sharedSecret (str):
            The main password used during the creation of a new
            node. This attribute is read from the local environment.
