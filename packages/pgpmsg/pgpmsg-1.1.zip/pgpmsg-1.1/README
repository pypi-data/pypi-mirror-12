pgpmsg.py

This is a fairly simply module which will decode OpenPGP messages (RFC
1440).  Such messages are generated by Gnu Privacy Guard and PGP. I
haven't made much effort to do any cryptographic operations because in
my case my purpose for creating the module was to write an OpenLDAP
backend that supported the kind of LDAP access present in PGP. The one
thing the module does do is compute public key fingerprints and key
ids. So, basically this module will let you read in a message (which
could be encrypted text or a pgp key) and will let you iterate over
the object and inspect its parts.

I've added some files to the source dist to aid in testing. 

These files were generated from pgp 2.6.3. That should help in testing
for old message formats. Their contents should be evident from the naming. 
The keyrings are from a single key. The passphrase for the secret key is: foobar.

I'm happy to accept any patches or enhancements anyone may come up with.
