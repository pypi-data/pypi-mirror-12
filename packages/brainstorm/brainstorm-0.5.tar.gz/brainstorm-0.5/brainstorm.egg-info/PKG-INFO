        0.5 (2015-12-01)
        ++++++++++++++++
        Changed Behaviour
        """""""""""""""""
        * examples now run on CPU by default
        * added ``brainstorm.tools.shuffle_data`` and ``brainstorm.tools.split`` to help with data preparation
        * ``SigmoidCE`` and ``SquaredDifference`` layers now outputs a loss for each dimension instead of summing over features.
        * ``SquaredDifference`` layer does no longer scale by one half.
        * Added a ``SquaredLoss`` layer that computes half the squared difference and
          has an interface that is compatible with the ``SigmoidCE`` and ``SigmoidCE`` layers.
        * Output `probabilities` renamed to `predictions` in ``SigmoidCE`` and ``SigmoidCE`` layers.
        
        New Features
        """"""""""""
        * added a `use_conv` option to ``brainstorm.tools.create_net_from_spec``
        * added `criterion` option to ``brainstorm.hooks.EarlyStopper`` hook
        * added ``brainstorm.tools.get_network_info`` function that returns information
          about the network as a string
        * added ``brainstorm.tools.extract`` function that applies a network to some
          data and saves a set of requested buffers.
        * ``brainstorm.layers.mask`` layer now supports masking individual features
        * added ``brainstorm.hooks.StopAfterThresholdReached`` hook
        
        Improvements
        """"""""""""
        * EarlyStopper now works for any timescale and interval
        * Recurrent, Lstm, Clockwork, and ClockworkLstm layers now accept inputs of
          arbitrary shape by implicitly flattening them.
        * several fixes to make building the docs easier
        * some performance improvements of NumpyHandler operations ``binarize_t`` and ``index_m_by_v``
        * sped up tests
        * several improvements to installation scripts
        
        Bugfixes
        """"""""
        * fixed `sqrt` operation for ``PyCudaHandler``. This should fix problems with BatchNormalization on GPU.
        * fixed a bug for task_type='regression' in ``brainstorm.tools.get_in_out_layers``
          and ``brainstorm.tools.create_net_from_spec``
        * removed defunct name argument from input layer
        * fixed a crash when applying ``brainstorm.hooks.SaveBestNetwork`` to `rolling_training` loss
        * various minor fixes of the ``brainstorm.hooks.BokehVisualizer``
        * fixed a problem with ``sum_t`` operation in ``brainstorm.handlers.PyCudaHandler``
        * fixed a blocksize problem in convolutional and pooling operations in ``brainstorm.handlers.PyCudaHandler``
        
        
        0.5b0 (2015-10-25)
        ++++++++++++++++++
        * First release on PyPI.
