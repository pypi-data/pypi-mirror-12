"Editing your website is not much different from surfing the web.  When "
"you're logged in to your website you will have the django CMS toolbar on top"
" of the page.  Slide the \"Edit mode\" button to the \"ON\" state, and some "
"elements of the page you're currently on start having additional toolbars to"
" add and edit content in those areas."

"You can safely modify content on the page without the website to change.  "
"Only you can see the changes, and only as long as you are in Edit mode.  "
"When you're happy with the changes press the blue \"Publish\" button on the "
"django CMS toolbar to make your version visible to the world."

"For more technical tasks like creating a navigation structure, adding pages,"
" etc. the django CMS toolbar redirects you to the Django administration "
"interface.  Want to have an upfront first impression before using it?  Check"

"Writing and publishing interesting articles now and then is called "
"\"blogging\".  It's very similar to the usual editing of your website, but "
"still it's different because you get more features as a natural add-on:  "
"Categories, tagging, comments, publication dates, archives (yearly, monthly,"
" daily), related entries, RSS feeds, etc."

"On your website you simply go to the Blog area, and click on the \"Add\" "
"link, which is available when you're logged in. In the blog entry editor you"
" have all functionality you already know from the content management "
"section.  Modifying existing blog entries works identical to the usual "
"content changes on your website with the exception of publishing, which is "
"not available with an intermediate draft step:  All your changes are "
"immediately visible online."
