PyScaffold
==========


PyScaffold helps you to easily setup a new Python project, it is as easy as::

    putup my_project

This will create a new subdirectory called *my_project*, inside which you
will find a git repository, *setup.py*, and the folders *document* and
*test*, ready for some serious coding.

Type ``putup -h`` to learn about more configuration options. PyScaffold assumes
that you have `Git  <http://git-scm.com/>`_ installed and set up on your PC,
meaning at least your name and email configured.
The scaffold of ``my_project`` provides you with a lot of
:ref:`features <features>`. PyScaffold is compatible with Python 2.7, 3.3 and
3.4.
