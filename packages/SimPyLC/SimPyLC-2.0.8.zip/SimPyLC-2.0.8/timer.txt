Timers should always be incremented.
So the must be some kind of integer, since with floats, rounding errors may prevent incrementing: 1e20 + 1 == 1e20.
A long integer is too short, because it will wrap around at 2^32 micros == 71.58 minutes.
Two long integers would work fine.

We could only have the sweeptime accurately, but other timers less so, e.g. with a resolution of 0.01 sec (able to run for 500 days).
