mlbgame is an API to read MLB GameDay XML and JSON data.
mlbgame works with real time data, getting information as games are being played.

mlbgame uses the same data that MLB GameDay uses,
and therefore is updated as soon as something happens in a game.

mlbgame currently comes pre-loaded with every game
from 2009 to the end of the 2015 season,
but will be updated regularly during the season.
Therefore, accessing this data does not actually make a request to mlb.com.

If you try to get data from a game that is not cached,
mlbgame will download the data from mlb.com.

Installation
------------

mlbgame is in the [Python Package Index (PyPI)](http://pypi.python.org/pypi/mlbgame/).
Installing with `pip` is recommended for all systems.

mlbgame can be installed by running:

    pip install mlbgame

(You may need to use `pip2` if Python 3 is the default on your system.)

mlbgame depends on `urllib2` to fetch data from mlb.com.
`urllib2` will be automatically installed if mlbgame is installed with `pip`.

mlbgame does not yet work on Python 3, but it should work with Python 2.6 and 2.7.

Updating the Game Database
--------------------------

Since games happen every day, new game data exists that is not stored on disk from the original install.
The database can be updated by running the following command:

    mlbgame-update-games


Examples
--------

Here is a quick teaser to find the scores of all home Mets games for the month of June, 2015:

    #!python
    import mlbgame
    
    month = mlbgame.games(2015, 6, home="Mets")
    for day in month:
        for game in day:
            print game
    
And the output is:

    Giants (5) at Mets (0)
    Giants (8) at Mets (5)
    Giants (4) at Mets (5)
    Braves (3) at Mets (5)
    Braves (5) at Mets (3)
    Braves (8) at Mets (10)
    Blue Jays (3) at Mets (4)
    Blue Jays (2) at Mets (3)
    Reds (1) at Mets (2)
    Reds (1) at Mets (2)
    Reds (1) at Mets (2)
    Reds (2) at Mets (7)
    Cubs (1) at Mets (0)

Or you could find the scores of every game on July 4th, 2015:

    #!python
    import mlbgame
    
    day = mlbgame.day(2015, 7, 4)
    for game in day:
        print game

And the output is:

    Angels (13) at Rangers (0)
    Indians (0) at Pirates (1)
    Rockies (3) at D-backs (7)
    Rays (2) at Yankees (3)
    Mets (3) at Dodgers (4)
    Orioles (2) at White Sox (3)
    Phillies (5) at Braves (9)
    Mariners (0) at Athletics (2)
    Giants (3) at Nationals (9)
    Brewers (7) at Reds (3)
    Padres (1) at Cardinals (2)
    Twins (5) at Royals (3)
    Astros (1) at Red Sox (6)
    Marlins (2) at Cubs (7)
    Blue Jays (3) at Tigers (8)

Maybe you want to know the pitchers for the Royals game on April 30th, 2015:

    #!python
    import mlbgame
    
    day = mlbgame.day(2015, 4, 12, home="Royals", away="Royals")
    game = day[0]
    output = "Winning pitcher: %s (%s) - Losing Pitcher: %s (%s)"
    print output % (game.w_pitcher, game.w_team, game.l_pitcher, game.l_team)

And the output is:

    Winning pitcher: Y. Ventura (Royals) - Losing Pitcher: C. Wilson (Angels)
