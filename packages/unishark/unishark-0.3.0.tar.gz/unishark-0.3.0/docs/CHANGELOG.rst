CHANGELOG
=========

0.3.0 (2015-11-06)
------------------

 - rewrote concurrent execution model. Now test fixtures setUpModule/tearDownModule setUpClass/tearDownClass will be executed once and only once no matter what concurrency level(module/class/method) of a suite is. Fixed the problem that module fixtures were executed multiple times when concurrency level was 'class' or 'method', and class fixtures were executed multiple times when concurrency level was 'method'.
 - changed the format of the concurrency-related settings in the dict config. Now 'max_workers' and 'level' are keys in the 'concurrency' sub-dict.
 - moved BufferedTestResult class from the runner module to the new result module which makes more sense.


0.2.3 (2015-10-01)
------------------

 - enable 'module' and 'method' level concurrent execution in a suite.


0.2.2 (2015-08-12)
------------------

 - support loading tests from a package with pattern matching, and excluding modules/classes/methods from the loaded tests.
 - add load_tests_from_package and load_tests_from_modules api.
 - rename load_test_from_dict to load_tests_from_dict.
 - fix that verbose stdout mode does not print test method doc string.
 - fix that tests loaded with method granularity are not filtered by method name pattern.
 - less strict dependency versions.


0.2.1 (2015-05-11)
------------------

 - support data-driven with multi-threads.
