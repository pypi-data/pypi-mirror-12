        A common question when reading an interesting paper is, "how does relate to my
        favorite gene locus?". To address this question, usually we need to download
        the supplemental data, figure out what format it's in, convert it to some other
        useful format, and visualize it alongside our own data.
        
        `hubward` helps manage this process, lowering the effort required to track,
        manage, organize, and upload many studies for cross-comparison in the UCSC
        Genome Browser.
        
        Data are organized into `track hubs
        <https://genome.ucsc.edu/goldenPath/help/hgTrackHubHelp.html>`_ on the UCSC
        Genome Browser, and the name `hubward` indicates the direction in which data
        are moved into these track hubs. It can also refer to a direction in `other
        complex systems <http://wiki.lspace.org/mediawiki/Hubwards>`_.
        
        The separate repository, `hubward-studies
        <https://github.com/daler/hubward-studies>`_, contains examples of prepared
        track hubs. Subsets of these can be combined into user-defined hubs, or can
        serve as examples for preparing other studies.
        
        Documentation can be found at `<https://daler.github.io/hubward>`_.
        
        Overview
        --------
        `This poster`_ gives an overview of `hubward`, and provides a worked example.

        History
        =======
        
        0.2.0 (2015-10-24)
        ------------------
        Streamlining of the code and CLI. This causes some backward
        incompatibility with `metadata.yaml` config files in version 0.1.0, in
        particular, the "source" section is now required. There is now a defined schema
        for the metadata and the grouping files so that future changes can be validated
        and automatically fixed.
        
        
        0.1.0 (2014-01-11)
        ---------------------
        
        * First release on PyPI.
