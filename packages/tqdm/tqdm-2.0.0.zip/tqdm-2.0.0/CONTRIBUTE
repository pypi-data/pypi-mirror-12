HOW TO CONTRIBUTE TO TQDM
=========================

This file describes how to contribute changes to the project, and how to
upload to the pypi repository.


HOW TO COMMIT YOUR CONTRIBUTIONS
--------------------------------

Contributions to the project is made using the "Fork & Pull" model. Here's a
quickstart on how to do that (your mileage may vary depending on your git
config):

- create an account on [github](https://github.com)
- fork [tqdm](https://github.com/tqdm/tqdm)
- make a local clone: `git clone https://github.com/your_account/tqdm.git`
- make your changes on your local copy
- commit your changes `git commit -m "my message"`
- TEST YOUR CHANGES (see below)
- `push` to your github account: `git push origin`
- finally, create a Pull Request (PR) from your github fork
(go to your fork's webpage and click on "Pull Request."
You can then add a message to describe your proposal.)


TESTING
-------

To test functionality on your machine (such as before submitting a Pull
Request), there are a number of unit tests.

To run the tests,

- install `tox`
- `cd` to the root of the `tqdm` directory (in the same folder as this file)
- run the following commands:

```
make test
make coverage
make flake8
```

Alternatively (if you can't use `make`)

- install `nosetest`
- run the following commands:

```
nosetests --with-coverage --cover-package=tqdm -v tqdm/
python -m flake8 tqdm/_tqdm.py
```
