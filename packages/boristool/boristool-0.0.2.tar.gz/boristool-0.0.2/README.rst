Boris-Tool Monitoring Agent
===========================

This is my fork of Chris Miles excellent eddie-tool which is a system and network monitoring, security, and performance analysis agent written in Python (https://pypi.python.org/pypi/EDDIE-Tool).

It uses the eddie-tool core rewritten to work with both Python 2.7 and 3.4+. I plan to redevelop the platform specific plug-ins using psutil which did not exist when eddie-tool was released.
