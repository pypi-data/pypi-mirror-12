* V1.6.12
  * adding CK_PYTHON env variable in ck script 
    to let user select required python version (python or python3)
  * automatically detecting python3 or python on Linux
  * fixing license of a php OpenME code - now the same as CK
    (tiny part to connect PHP-based web requests to CK)
  * adding 'find' function to 'repo' module and changing
    default behavior. Now "ck find repo:<name>" returns
    path to repository rather than to meta. To return
    path to meta, use "ck find repo:<name> --meta".
    Closes ticket #45
  * automatically detecting server host and port, if used!
    Closes ticket #38

  * adding --min flag to ''load'' function to output 
    only desc and dict to console
