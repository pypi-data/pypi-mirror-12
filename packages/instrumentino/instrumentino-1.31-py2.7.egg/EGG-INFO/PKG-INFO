Description: 
        Instrumentino is an open-source modular graphical user interface framework for controlling Arduino based experimental instruments.
        It expands the control capability of Arduino by allowing instruments builders to easily create a custom user interface program running on an attached personal computer.It enables the definition of operation sequences and their automated running without user intervention.
        
        Acquired experimental data and a usage log are automatically saved on the computer for further processing.
        
        Complex devices, which are difficult to control using an Arduino, may be integrated as well by incorporating third party application programming interfaces (APIs) into the Instrumentino framework.
        
        It consists of two separate programs:
        
          * *instrumentino*: which is run on a PC and provides the graphical user interface.
        
          * *controlino*:    which is the program running on the Arduino controller itself, and is used to communicate with instrumentino.

            On the top of the controlino sketch, there are define statements to adjust it to different Arduino boards. **Please make sure you set them correctly**.

        We are looking forward for contributors.
        There is lots of potential for Instrumentino to grow!
