schematax is a simple Python package to do all things related to schemata_.

A schema is word made using an extra symbol, '*', called the wild card symbol.
For example the schema over the binary aplhapbet '1*0', represents the set of
strings. {'100','110'}'.

Schema have properties. For example, for a schema s, the order of s is the
number of symbols in s which are not the wild card symbols (called fixed symbols).
The defining length of s is the distance between the first and last fixed symbol.  

Given a set of words of the same length S, the schematic completion of S
returns all schema which make subsets of the words in S. 
Whats more given the partial ordering over schemata, the schematic completion of S
forms a `Complete Lattice`_.

Installation
------------

This package runs under Python 2.7, use pip_ to install:

.. code:: bash

    $ pip install schematax

This will also install the graphviz_ package from PyPI as
required dependencies.

**Important**: Drawing the the schematic lattice uses `Graphviz software`_. Make sure it
is installed and ``dot`` executable is on your systems' path.


Quickstart
----------
The file example.py gives a good overview of how to use the package.

Basic schema operations:

.. code-block:: python

    >>> import schematax

    >>> s = schematax.schema('10*1') #makes a schema

    >>> s
    10*1

    >>> s.get_order()
    3

    >>> s.get_defining_length()
    3

    >>> s2 = schematax.schema('1**1') #makes another schema

    >>> s <= s2 
    True

    >>> s < s2
    True

    >>> s == s2
    False
 
    >>> schematax.meet(s,s2)
    10*1

    >>> schematax.join(s,s2)
    1**1

    >>> s3 = schematax.schema('00*1')
    
    >>> schematax.supremum([s,s2,s3])
    ***1

    >>> schematax.infimum([s,s2,s3])
    e                               #e stands for the empty schema

Schematic completion and drawing the schematic lattice:

.. code-block:: python
    
    >>> import schematax
    
    >>> xs = ['111', '011', '001']
    
    >>> ss = schematax.complete(xs) #performing schematic completion 
    
    >>> ss
    [111, 011, 001,``*11``, ``**1``, ``0*1``, e] #e stands for the empty schema

    >>> schematax.draw(ss,'my_lattice') #draws the schematic lattice of ss and saves it as my_lattice.pdf
