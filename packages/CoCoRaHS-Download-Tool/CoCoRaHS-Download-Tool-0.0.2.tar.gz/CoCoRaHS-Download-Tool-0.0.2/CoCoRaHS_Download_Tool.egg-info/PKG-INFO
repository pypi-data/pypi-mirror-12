        Usage
        =====
        
        The **CoCoRaHS-Download-Tool** tool has two modes of operation, listing of 
        CoCoRaHS station metadata, and listing of CoCoRaHS station data.
        
        Stations Metadata
        -----------------
        
        To list CoCoRaHS stations metadata for the default state (NM) the following 
        command is issued::
        
            $ python -m cocorahs_dlt stations
        
        To save the output of this operation, run::
        
            $ python -m cocorahs_dlt stations > stations.csv
        
        To download and save CoCoRaHS stations metadata for a different state 
        (specified by the two-character state code), the following command is 
        issued::
        
            $ python -m cocorahs_dlt --state CO stations > stations.csv
        
        
        Stations Data
        -------------
        
        To list CoCoRaHS stations data for the default state (NM), the default
        date range (last three days), and the default output (CSV) the following 
        command is issued::
        
            $ python -m cocorahs_dlt data
        
        To save the output of this operation, run::
        
            $ python -m cocorahs_dlt data > data.csv
        
        To download and save CoCoRaHS stations data for a different state 
        (specified by the two-character state code), the following command is 
        issued::
        
            $ python -m cocorahs_dlt --state CO data > data.csv
        
        To download and save CoCoRaHS stations data for a different state 
        (specified by the two-character state code) and in a different output format, 
        the following command is issued::
        
            $ python -m cocorahs_dlt --state CO data --format XML > data.xml
        
        To download and save CoCoRaHS stations data for a different state 
        (specified by the two-character state code) in a different output format, and 
        with volunteer comments, the following command is issued::
        
            $ python -m cocorahs_dlt --state CO data --format XML --comments > data.xml
        
        To download and save CoCoRaHS stations data for a different state 
        (specified by the two-character state code) in a different output format, 
        with volunteer comments, and for a different date range, the following command 
        is issued::
        
            $ python -m cocorahs_dlt --state CO data --format XML --comments --start_date 2014-09-13 --end_date 2014-09-21 > data.xml
        
        To only list the data from the previous command, the *> data.xml* text is dropped::
        
            $ python -m cocorahs_dlt --state CO data --format XML --comments --start_date 2014-09-13 --end_date 2014-09-21
