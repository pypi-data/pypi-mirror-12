Description: CssCoco is a tool that automatically discovers violations of code conventions in your CSS code. The tool is designed to offer great flexibility and cover a wide range of conventions, e.g. whitespacing, indentation, syntax preference and anti-patterns. Unlike other solutions, CssCoco uses a domain-specific language that allows you to tailor the conventions according to your own needs and preferences. And in case writing conventions in a new DSL is a bit too much, you can always use one of the popular ready-to-use convention sets available in the CssCoco GitHub repo. Happy coding!
