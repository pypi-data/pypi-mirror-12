Description: # django-deployment
        Use Fabric and Chef-Solo to manage deployment
        
        Start by defining the information for your server. You can do this perhaps in local_settings.py or settings.py.
        
        
        from fabric.api import env
        env.hosts = ["server_ip"]
        env.user = "user"
        env.password = "password"
        
        There are a bunch of templates that can be overriden to configure deployment. During the deployment process,
        these files are generated and sent up to the server, so Chef can use them. We use Django inheritance, so 
        any changes you make will be picked up.
