Description: 
        sofficehelpers
        ==============
        
        This is a small, highly opinionated, and not generally useful package developed
        to deal with soffice/LibreOffice files in the Tendril framework.
        
        Various other packages may exist to perform the same tasks and much more, and you
        should consider using them instead.
        
        At present, the only script this file contains is the ``ssconverter`` script, which
        converts a Spreadsheet into csv files.
        
        The need for this package exists because the LibreOffice API requires you to use
        the same Python version as is built into LibreOffice, which in the case of Ubuntu
        14.04 is Python 3.4.
        
        Installation
        ------------
        
        This package has been tested only with python 3.4 and the LibreOffice installed
        from standard Ubuntu 14.04 repositories. You should make sure the correct version
        of ``uno`` is installed in your python environment::
        
            $ python3
            Python 3.4.0 (default, Jun 19 2015, 14:20:21)
            [GCC 4.8.2] on linux
            >>> import uno
            >>>
        
        This package can be installed from pypi using pip::

        Or by using setup.py::
        
            $ python3 setup.py install
