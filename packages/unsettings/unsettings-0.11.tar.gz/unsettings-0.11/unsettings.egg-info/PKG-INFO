        ================================
         What is Unsettings?
        ================================
        
        Unsettings is a graphical configuration program for the Unity desktop
        environment that lets you change some oft the Unity settings.
        
        Unsettings can only change your users's settings, you can't use it to
        change global settings or do anything else that needs root
        privileges.
        
        You can use Unsettings to change the themes for GTK, window manger,
        icons and cursors. But it doesn't support the installation of new
        themes.
        
        With Unsettings you can switch off the global menu and the overlay
        scrollbars used in Unity.
        
        In addition to just applying the settings Unsettings lets you to save
        your settings into and load from a text file (JSON format) so you can
        easily backup you settings or copy them to a different account.

        ========
         Status
        ========
        
        Unsettings is Alpha software. It works for me but I expect it to have quite some bugs. The user interface and the file format may change in future version. **Use it at your own risk.**
        
        If you find a bug in Unsettings please report it at the `bugtracker at Launchpad <https://bugs.launchpad.net/unsettings/+filebug>`_
        so that I can fix it. Thank you.
