utf9

*Encode and decode text using UTF-9.*

Description
-----------

On April 1st 2005, IEEE released the `RFC4042`_ “*UTF-9 and UTF-18
Efficient Transformation Formats of Unicode*” :

    The current representation formats for Unicode (UTF-7, UTF-8,
    UTF-16) are not storage and computation efficient on platforms that
    utilize the 9 bit nonet as a natural storage unit instead of the 8
    bit octet.

Since there are not so many architecture that use *9 bit nonets as
natural storage units* and the release date was on April Fools’ Day, the
*beautiful* UTF-9 was forgotten and no python implementation is
available.

This python module is here to fill this gap! ;)

Usage
-----

There are only two functions:

-  ``utf9encode(string)``: takes a string and returns a utf9-encoded
   version.
-  ``utf9decode(data)``: takes utf9-encoded data and returns the
   corresponding string.

Example
-------

    >>> import utf9
    >>> encoded = utf9.utf9encode(u'ႹЄLᒪo, 🌍ǃ')
    >>> print repr(encoded)
    'p\xe0\xb7-\x0c!1\xc3\x92\xd5\x1b\xc5\x82\x07n\x83x\xed\xdecX\xf80'
    >>> print utf9.utf9decode(encoded)
    ႹЄLᒪo, 🌍ǃ
