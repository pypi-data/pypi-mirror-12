== Version 1.3.2 ==

Since this version, `guidata` is compatible with !PyQt4 API #1 *and* API #2.
Please read carefully the coding guidelines which have been recently added to 
the documentation.

=== Possible API compatibility issues (since v1.3.1) ===

  * Removed deprecated wrappers around QFileDialog's static methods (use the 
    wrappers provided by `guidata.qt.compat` instead):
    * getExistingDirectory, getOpenFileName, getOpenFileNames, getSaveFileName

=== Bug fixes (since v1.3.1) ===

  * qtwidgets.!ShowFloatArrayWidget: fixed string float formatting issue (replaced %f by %g)
  * Fixed compatiblity issues with !PyQt v4.4 [Contributor: Carlos Pascual]
  * Fixed missing 'child_title' attribute error with !FileOpenItem, !FilesOpenItem, !FileSaveItem and !DirectoryItem
  * (Fixes Issue 8) disthelpers.add_modules was failing when vs2008=False

=== Other changes (since v1.3.1) ===

  * added *this* changelog
  * qtwidgets: removed !ProgressPopUp dialog (it is now recommended to use !QProgressDialog instead, which is pretty much identical)
  * Replaced !QScintilla by spyderlib (as a dependency for array editor, code editor (test launcher) and dict editor)
  * qtwidgets.!DockWidgetMixin: added method 'setup_dockwidget' to change dockwidget's features, location and allowed areas after class instantiation
  * guidata.utils.utf8_to_unicode: translated error message in english
  * Add support for 'int' in hdf5 save function
  * guidata.dataset/Numeric items (!FloatItem, !IntItem): added option 'unit' (automatically add suffix ' (unit)' to label in edit mode and suffix ' unit' to value in read-only mode)
  * Improved dataset __str__ method: code refactoring with read-only dataset widgets (!DataItem: added methods 'format_string' and 'get_string_value', !DataSet: added method 'to_string')
  * Added coding guidelines to the documentation
  * guidata.dataset.qtwidget: added specific widget (!ShowBooleanWidget) for read-only display of bool items (text is striked out when value is False)
  * guidata.hdf5io.Dset: added missing keyword argument 'optional' (same effect as parent class Attr)
  * guidata.dataset.dataitems.!IntItem objects: added support for sliders (fixes Issue 9) with option slider=True (see documentation)

  * Tests: now creating real temporary files and cleaning up at exit

  * qthelpers: added helper 'create_groupbox' (QGroupBox object creation)
  * Array editor: updated code from Spyder's array editor (original code)
  * Added package guidata.editors: contains editor widgets derived from Spyder editor widgets (array editor, dictionary editor, text editor)
  * Array editor: added option to set row/col labels (resp. ylabels and xlabels)
  * !ButtonItem: changed callback arguments to  *instance* (!DataSet object), *value* (item value), *parent* (button's parent widget)
  * editors.!DictEditor.!DictEditor: moved options from constructor to 'setup' method (like !ArrayEditor's setup_and_check), added parent widget to constructor options
  * Added !DictItem type: simple button to edit a dictionary
  * editors.!DictEditor.!DictEditor/bugfixes: added action "Insert" to context menu for an empty dictionary + fixed inline unicode editing (was showing the error message "Unable to assign data to item")

  * gettext helpers: added support for individual module translation (until now, only whole packages were supported)
  * !DataSetShowGroupBox/!DataSetEditGroupBox: **kwargs may now be passed to the !DataSet constructor
  * disthelpers: added 'scipy.io' to supported modules (includes)
  * Added new "value_callback" display property: this function is called when QLineEdit text has changed (item value is passed)
  * Added option to pass a text formatting function in !DataSetShowWidget
