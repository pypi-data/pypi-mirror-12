Description: # ** DISCLAIMER **
        This API is in constant development. Do not rely on it too much until its in stable release.
        All except for the last two APIs ( InboundShipment and OutboundShipment ) are complete.
        Help towards completing this last two APIs would be greatly appreciated.
        I will mark this as stable 1.0 once all tests have been completed.

        # Python Amazon MWS
        
        Python Amazon MWS is a python interface for the Amazon MWS API.
        I wrote it to help me upload my products to amazon. However, seeing its potential i decided
        to expand it in order for it to cover most ( if not all ) operations in the Amazon MWS.
        
        This is still an ongoing project. If you would like to contribute, see below :).
        
        
        Its based on the [amazon-mws-python](http://code.google.com/p/amazon-mws-python).
