        <h1>overview</h1>
        <p>
            To allow integration with other web applications and services,
            statscache offers a simple, easy-to-use REST API with support for
            multiple convenient data formats.
        </p>
    </section>
{# This page really ought to be more thorough #}
    <section>
        <h2>queries</h2>
        <p>
            The API is accessible under the <code>{{ url_for('plugin_index') }}
            </code> tree. As this interface is meant to export data, only
            <code>GET</code> requests are supported on all endpoints.
        </p>
        <section>
            <h4>index</h4>
            <p>
                The list of available models is accessible via at
                <code>{{ url_for('plugin_index') }}</code>. The identifiers are
                composed of ASCII characters excluding spaces, single or double
                quotes, punctuation, parantheses, ampersands, and asterisks.
            </p>

            <h4>layout</h4>
            <p>
                Certain models are associated with a <em>layout</em> attribute
                that describes the structure of the model. If a given model
                <code>model</code> has a layout attribute, it is accessible
                at <code>{{ url_for('plugin_layout', ident='model') }}</code>.
            </p>

            <h4>feed</h4>
            <p>
                The rows of any model <code>model</code> that was listed by the
                index may be retrieved at the
                <code>{{ url_for('plugin_model', ident='model') }}</code>
                endpoint. Because a literal dump of the database table would be
                ridicoulously inefficient, the results of any query are
                paginated using the protocol discussed later. Queries may be
                customized using the following query string parameters:
                <ul style="line-spacing: 2pt;">
                    <li>
                        <code>order</code>:
                        <code>desc</code> or <code>asc</code> to descend
                        (default) or ascend by row timestamp, respectively.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        <code>limit</code>:
                        a natural number (integer greater than or equal to
                        zero) to restrict the number of rows in the result to
                        at most that many, prior to pagination.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        <code>rows_per_page</code>:
                        an integer in the interval [0, 100] (defaulting to 100)
                        which will be the number of rows returned in each page.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        <code>page</code>:
                        a number <em>n</em> greater than zero (defaulting to 1)
                        to request the <em>n</em>th page of rows, which are the
                        <code>rows_per_page</code> rows after skipping the
                        initial (<em>n</em>-1)&times;<code>rows_per_page</code>
                        rows.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        <code>start</code>:
                        an integer or floating-point number that is interpreted
                        as the second-based UNIX timestamp before which rows
                        are filtered out.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        <code>stop</code>:
                        an integer or floating-point number that is interpreted
                        as the second-based UNIX timestamp after which rows
                        are filtered out.
                    </li>
                </ul>

        <h2>formats</h2>
        <p>
            With the exception of layouts, all endpoints support serialization
            to JSON[-P] and CSV. The HTTP <code>Accept</code> header is what
            determines the format of the response. Both the <code>text/</code>
            or <code>application/</code> prefixes are accepted. Note that a
            request for JavaScript content is interpreted exactly the same as
            a request for JSON data, and in either case a JSON-P request will
            get a response with a JavaScript mime-type.
        </p>
    </section>
    <section>
        <h2>cross-origin</h2>
        <p>
            The statscache web API supports Cross-Origin Resource Sharing
            (CORS), an opt-in mechanism to allow direct AJAX requests and
            access to designated response headers. Using CORS requires no
            additional work on your part, as most major JavaScript libraries
            transparently activate it when appropriate.
        </p>
        <p>
            Cross-origin AJAX requests may also be done the traditional way,
            using JSON-P, but that method is neither necessary not recommended.
            JSON-P is limited in that there is no way to retrieve the response
            headers, which statscache uses to pass on important metadata
            regarding pagination. Still, if you are in a situation where there
            are compelling reasons to do so, using JSON-P is an option.
        </p>
        <aside>
            <p>
                JSON-P, or JSON with padding, is a mechanism to circumvent
                cross-origin AJAX request restrictions by wrapping the data in
                a function invocation, the name of which is provided in the
                <code>callback</code> query argument.
            </p>
        </aside>
    </section>
    <section>
        <h2>pagination</h2>
        <p>
            In feed responses, statscache passes on information about
            pagination through several headers. (If you're familiar with the
            GitHub API, this mechanism is very similar.) The <code>Link</code>
            header is used to provide links to the <code>next</code> and <code>
            previous</code> pages, if they exist. Every response also includes
            an <code>X-Link-Number</code> and an <code>X-Link-Count</code>
            header, which give the current page number (starting from one) and
            the total number of pages, respectively.
