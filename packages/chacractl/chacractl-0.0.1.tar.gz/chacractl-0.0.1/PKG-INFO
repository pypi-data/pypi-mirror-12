Description: ``chacractl``
        -------------
        A client interface to interact with the ``chacra`` service
        (http://github.com/ceph/chacra).
        
        
        configuration
        -------------
        The client writes a configuration file at ``$HOME/.chacractl`` with some needed
        information::
        
            # This file was automatically generated by the chacractl CLI
            # make sure to update it with the correct user and key to talk to the API
        
            url = "http://example/"
            user = "admin"
            key = "secret"
        
        These values need to be modified so that the CLI can interact with the remote
        API.
        
        binaries
        --------
        The CLI allows for a few interactions with binaries, depending on the action
        needed the requirements may change. For example when trying to upload a binary,
        the tool can accept either ``stdin`` or an actual file input.
        
        create
        ^^^^^^
        For POSTing a binary, if posting a single binary it is best to just pass the
        full path as the last argument to the ``binary`` subcommand::
        
            chacractl binary create project/ref/distro/distro-version/arch /path/to/binary.rpm
        
        But for convenience, if sending many files, it can also accept them from stdin,
        usually with the output of a ``find`` command that can be filtered with
        ``grep`` or similar.
        
        Below is an example of such a command for a project like ``ceph-deploy``::
        
            find ~/repos | grep ceph-deploy | grep rpm | grep noarch | grep el6
            | chacractl binary create ceph-deploy/master/centos/6/noarch
