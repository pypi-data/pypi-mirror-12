This is the README file for EzDialog

EzDialog is a simple Python library for "newer" Python programmers that want
to add GUIs to their script without having to know a lot about GUI programming.
It uses Tkinter and ttk which should be included in most Python installations

All the installer really need to do is to place ezdialog.py somewhere in the
Python path.
