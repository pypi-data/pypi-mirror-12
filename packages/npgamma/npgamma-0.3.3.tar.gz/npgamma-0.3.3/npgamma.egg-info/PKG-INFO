Description: Using numpy to find the gamma index / gamma evaluation. This gamma index is often used in Medical Physics. Example of the code in action can be found [here (3d)](http://nbviewer.ipython.org/github/SimonBiggs/npgamma/blob/master/example_3d.ipynb), and [here (2d)](http://nbviewer.ipython.org/github/SimonBiggs/npgamma/blob/master/example_2d_equal_grid.ipynb).
