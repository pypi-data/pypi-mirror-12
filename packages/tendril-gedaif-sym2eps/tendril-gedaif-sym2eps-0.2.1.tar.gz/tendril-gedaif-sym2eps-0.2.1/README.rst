Provides a _very_ simple wrapper around DJ Delorie's ``sym2eps``.

This package (and the wrapper) are mostly for fun and for having a simple
reference implementation for a Cython wrapper package handy. There isn't
much inherent utility to it. Normally, you would just use DJ Delorie's C file
`sym2eps.cc <http://www.gedasymbols.org/user/dj_delorie/tools/sym2eps.cc>`_
directly. Or better yet, the ``gaf`` binary from ``geda 1.9.2``, and get much
more than you would from here. This wrapper, for instance, doesn't support
reading from and writing to stdin/stdout, which the C file does.

The excuse for writing this wrapper was to be able to remove the C code and
the consequent requirement of figuring out a safe build process for it from
within the ``tendril`` core module. This way, we just list this package
as a dependency and let setuptools / distutils take care of it.

Installation
------------
::

    pip install tendril-gedaif-sym2eps

Usage Example
-------------

    >>> import sym2eps

.. hint:: The paths specified here should either be absolute or relative
          to the CWD.

.. warning:: This module is currently broken. It will segfault if you try
             to convert multiple files. If you think you can fix it, see
             the ``convert()`` function of ``src/_sym2eps.cc``.
