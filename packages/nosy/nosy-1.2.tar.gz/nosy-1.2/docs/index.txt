Hacking on Jeff Winkler's Nosy
==============================

I discovered Jason Pellerin's `nose`_ test discovery and execution
tool when I started using `TurboGears`_.  My first forays into test
driven development and automated Python testing weren't all that
successful though.  Then talks by `Jonathan Hartley`_,
and by `Titus Brown`_ at PyCon 2008, and a lobby chat with Jonathan
just before I left Chicago got me thinking differently, and more
seriously about automated testing.  A few days later, the penny
dropped, and I'm a convert!

Then I came across a little script called ``nosy`` that Jeff Winkler
described in a (now vanished) blog post in April of 2006. ``nosy`` runs
``nose`` whenever a source file has changed.  I'd thought about doing
something like that but was thinking I'd have to use some kind of
continuous integration system like `buildbot`_, and that seemed like a
whole lot of trouble for some little personal projects.  Jeff's trick
for calculating a checksum for the source files makes it all very,
*very* easy.  His original nosy.py script was less than 20 lines long!

I liked ``nosy`` on sight but after playing with it for a short time
wanted to add features and flexibility.  I like to keep my test code
in a ``tests/`` directory, separate from my project code.  I wanted
``nose`` to run whenever I changed either the project code, or the
test code.  I wanted to be able to change the way ``nose`` ran,
turning options like ``-s`` and ``-v`` on or off, and specifying
particular parts of the test suite to run via command line arguments.

So, I decided that ``nosy`` needed the option of having a
configuration file.  Of course that meant that it needed a command
line processor.  `ConfigParser`_ and `optparse`_ from the Python
standard library to the rescue, and we have my version of nosy::

  $ nosy -h
  Usage: nosy [options]

  Automatically run test runner (nosetests, by default) whenever
  source files change.

  Options:
    -h, --help            show this help message and exit
    -c CONFIG_FILE, --config=CONFIG_FILE
                          configuration file path and name; defaults to
                          setup.cfg

.. _optparse: http://docs.python.org/lib/module-optparse.html

In version 1.2 ``nosy``

* got generalized to run whatever test runner you specify,
  though it defaults to running ``nosetests``

* changed from `optparse`_ to `argparse`_ for command line processing

* added support for Python 3.3, 3.4, and 3.5.

.. _argparse: https://docs.python.org/3/library/argparse.html

You should be able to install ``nosy`` with::

  $ pip install -U nosy

Throw a section something like this into your ``setup.cfg`` file::

  # Sample config file section for nosy

  # Including this file in the paths to check allows you to change
  # nose's behaviour on the fly.

  [nosy]
  # Test runner command to use; defaults to nosetests
  # Other possibilites:
  #test_runner = python manage.py test         # Django
  #test_runner = python -m unittest discover   # Python 2.7 unittest
  # Paths to check for changed files; changes cause test runner to be run
  base_path = ./
  glob_patterns = *.py
  exclude_patterns = *_flymake.*
  extra_paths = setup.cfg
  # Command line options to pass to test runner
  options = -x
  # Command line arguments to pass to test runner;
  # e.g. part of test suite to run
  tests = tests/unit_tests.py

launch ``nosy``::

  $ nosy

and away you go.  The specified test runner will run whenever any of
the ``*.py`` files in your project, or ``setup.cfg`` change.

If you prefer, you can use a separate config file just for ``nosy``,
say ``tests/nosy.cfg``, and launch ``nosy`` with::

    $ nosy -c tests/nosy.cfg

As of version 1.1 ``nosy`` has new configuration options to make it
easier to use in projects with deep directory structures. The checksum
calculator now uses ``os.walk()`` starting from ``base_path``,
including files given by a list of ``glob_patterns``, excluding those
given by a list of ``exclude_patterns``. Files given by the
``extra_paths`` list are also glob-ed in to handle anything that the
first 3 options don't easily catch. Thanks to Jussi Rasinm√§ki for the
suggestion.

Putting the config file itself in the list of files to watch
(typically via the ``extra_paths`` option) allows you to change the
behaviour of the test runner without having to stop and restart
``nosy``.

``options`` are the command line options to pass to the test
runner. Use ``-v`` to turn on verbose output, or ``-a foo`` with
``nosetests`` to run only the tests with attribute ``foo``.

``tests`` are the command line arguments to pass to the test runner,
used to select specific tests to run.
