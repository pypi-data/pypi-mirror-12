Description: # Steamy
        Steamy is a lightweight, limited-abstraction interface to both the [public Steam Web API](https://developer.valvesoftware.com/wiki/Steam_Web_API) and a custom Steam Market API.
        
        ## Public Steam Web API
        To interface with the public Steam Web API, you must have a [Steam API Key](https://steamcommunity.com/dev/apikey). To get started, create an instance of the SteamAPI interface:
        
        ```
        steam = SteamAPI(my_api_key)
        ```
        
        ### Examples
        
        Get a trade offer
        ```
        offer = steam.get_trade_offer(offer_id)
        assert offer['tradeofferid'] == offer_id
        ```
        
        Get members for a group
        ```
        members = steam.get_group_members("testgroupplzignore", page=1)
        assert len(members)
        ```
        
        ### Workshop Interface
        The SteamAPI interface also provides the ability to query workshop items:
        
        ```
        wfile = steam.get_workshop_file("447269341")
        assert isinstance(wfile, WorkshopFile)
        assert wfile.id == "447269341"
        ```
