Multiple Component Directories
===============================

BowerStatic provides the possibility to create more than one
``bower_components`` directory. Each directory is an "isolated universe" of
components. Components in a ``bower_components`` directory can depend on each
other only â€“ they cannot depend on components in another directory.

To use more than one ``bower_components`` directory, you need to give them
names:

.. code-block:: python

    config.add_bower_components('myapp:static/components_dir', name='dir')

You can use components from this directory as follows:

.. code-block:: python

    request.include('bootstrap', components_name='dir')

To use this ``bower_components`` directory for local components:

.. code-block:: python

    config.add_bower_component('myapp:static/my_component', components_name='dir')

After that, you can include your local components on the HTML page:

.. code-block:: python

    request.include('my_component', components_name='dir')
