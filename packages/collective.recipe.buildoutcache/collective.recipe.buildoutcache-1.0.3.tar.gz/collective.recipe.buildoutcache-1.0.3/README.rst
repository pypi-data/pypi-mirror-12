Introduction
============

This recipe is used to generate buildout-cache.tar.gz2 file.

The recipe was inspired by update-packages script from Plone Installers-UnifiedInstaller (https://github.com/plone/Installers-UnifiedInstaller/blob/master/update_packages.py)
The recipe will start a buildout with forced eggs-directory and download-cache. After it will deleted eggs with binary components, make some cleanup, and finally generate compressed file contains buildout-cache.


Supported options
=================

The recipe supports the following optionnal options:

.. Note to recipe author!
   ----------------------
   For each option the recipe uses you should include a description
   about the purpose of the option, the format and semantics of the
   values it accepts, whether it is mandatory or optional and what the
   default value is if it is omitted.


target
    Name of target compressed file. Default value is `buildout-cache.tar.bz2`.

buildout_file
    Name of buildout file which be used for constuction of buildout cache. Default value is `buildout.cfg`.

work_dir
    Directory where eggs are downloaded for creation of tar.gz2 file. This directroy is deleted before and after the script. Default value is `tmp`.

timeout
    Timeout using for buildout in second. If no timeout define but a socket-timeout into buildout section, socket-timeout value is used. Default value is 10.

preremove_old_work_dir
    Sometime we want to keep word_dir if a build failed. Default value is True, so work_dir will be deleted by default.


Example usage
=============

We'll start by creating a `buildout.cfg` file that uses the recipe:

::

    [buildout]
    parts = makebuildoutcache

    [makebuildoutcache]
    recipe = collective.recipe.buildoutcache
    target = buildout-cache.tar.bz2
    buildout_file = buildout.cfg
    work_dir = my-temp-buildout-work-dir

For recipe installation you can make this command line:

::

    ./bin/buildout install makebuildoutcache

And start recipe script:

::

    ./bin/makebuildoutcache

Then all these packages will download temporally into the directory **my-temp-buildout-work-dir** defined and later it will create a **buildout-cache.tar.bz2** file in the Buildout directory.

buildout-cache.tar.bz2 archive
==============================

The **buildout-cache.tar.bz2** archive contains one single buildout-cache folder. In this folder, there are 2 folders:

* **eggs:** contains all eggs use by your buildout except eggs which have to be compiled.

* **downloads:** contains zip eggs which must be compiled (as AccessControl, lxml, Pillow, ZODB, ...).

Before starting a buildout, we download and extract buildout-cache and use it on our buildout directory. We add eggs-directory and download-cache parameters on buildout section like this:

::

    [buildout]

    eggs-directory = buildout-cache/eggs
    download-cache = buildout-cache/downloads
