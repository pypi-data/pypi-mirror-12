Description: IPython-extensions: more magic(s) for IPython
        =============================================
        
        This package consists of various IPython extensions (mostly new
        %magics). It exists mainly to make installation of these extension
        easier: you only need to install and update one package to get multiple
        extensions. Also, the up-to-now used ``%install_ext`` magic is
        `deprecated and will be removed in a future
        version <https://github.com/ipython/ipython/pull/8763>`__, so the only
        way to distribute extensions is via python packages.
        
        Documentation
        -------------
        
        The documentation can be found on
        http://ipython-extensions.readthedocs.org/en/latest/
        
        Contributing
        ------------
        
        You have an IPython extension (e.g. a ``%magic`` command) but it's too
        small to build your own package? You are welcome to contribute it to
        this repository!
        
        To prevent bit rot, it should follow the guidelines outlined in
        `CONTRIBUTING.md <CONTRIBUTING.md>`__, meaning:
        
        -  it should be IPython centric (notebook centric extensions belong to
           the `jupyter notebook extension
           repo <https://github.com/ipython-contrib/IPython-notebook-extensions>`__)
        -  it should have proper documentation (preferable in `numpydoc
           style <https://github.com/numpy/numpy/blob/master/doc/HOWTO_DOCUMENT.rst.txt>`__)
        -  it should have a few tests of the functionality (see examples in this
           repository or in
           `IPython <https://github.com/ipython/ipython/blob/master/IPython/core/tests/test_magic.py>`__)
