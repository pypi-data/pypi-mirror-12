def work_time_df(projects, human_only=True, complete_tasks_only=True):

    Return projects' task assignment iteration timing information.

    The returned dataframe's schema is:
        project_id: the project's ID
        task_id: the task's ID
        assignment_level: a 1-indexed assignment counter (1 is entry-level, 2
            is first review, etc.)
        worker: the username of the worker on that assignment
        iteration: a work iteration for the assignment:
            - Iteration 0 represents the period from previous submission to
            reviewer assignment:
                - If this is the first assignment, 'previous submission'
                  means 'task creation'.
                - For iteration 0, work time will always be 0
                - If this task is auto-assigned, iteration 0's calendar time
                  will be close to 0.
            - Iterations N > 0 represent the period between a previous worker's
                input (submit/accept/reject) and the worker's submission.
        start_datetime: the time the iteration started.
        calendar_time: the wallclock time it took for the worker to complete
            that iteration.
        work_time: the amount of work time the worker reported dedicating to
            that iteration (0 for iteration 0).

    Args:
        projects (django.db.models.query.QuerySet):
            An iterable of projects to include in the report.
