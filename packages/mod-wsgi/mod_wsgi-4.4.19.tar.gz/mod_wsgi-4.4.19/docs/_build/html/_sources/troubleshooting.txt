.. warning ::

   Documentation linked here is actually located on the old Google Code
   site and has not yet been transitioned to this site. Some documentation
   on the old site may be out of date, especially anything related to
   running mod_wsgi on Windows. For more details as to why and the links to
   all the old documentation see :doc:`project-status`.

If you are having problems getting mod_wsgi to start up or do what you want
it to do, first off ensure that you read the following documents:

* `Installation Issues <https://code.google.com/p/modwsgi/wiki/InstallationIssues>`_
* `Configuration Issues <https://code.google.com/p/modwsgi/wiki/ConfigurationIssues>`_
* `Application Issues <https://code.google.com/p/modwsgi/wiki/ApplicationIssues>`_

If none of the common issues match up with the problem you are seeing and
are after other ideas, or you have the need to perform more low level
debugging, check out the following document:

* `Developer Guidelines <https://code.google.com/p/modwsgi/wiki/DeveloperGuidelines>`_

You can also do some basic checking of your installation and configuration
to validate that how it is setup is how you expect it to be. See the
following document:

* `Checking Your Installation <https://code.google.com/p/modwsgi/wiki/CheckingYourInstallation>`_
