.. warning ::

   Documentation linked here is actually located on the old Google Code
   site and has not yet been transitioned to this site. Some documentation
   on the old site may be out of date, especially anything related to
   running mod_wsgi on Windows. For more details as to why and the links to
   all the old documentation see :doc:`project-status`.

In addition to the quick configuration guide found at:

* `Quick Configuration Guide <https://code.google.com/p/modwsgi/wiki/QuickConfigurationGuide>`_

additional details on the configuration directives in mod_wsgi and how to
use them is available in the following documents:

* `Configuration Guidelines <https://code.google.com/p/modwsgi/wiki/ConfigurationGuidelines>`_
* `Configuration Directives <https://code.google.com/p/modwsgi/wiki/ConfigurationDirectives>`_
