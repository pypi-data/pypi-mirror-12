PyPSTools
=========

A library for commonly used power system algorithms (e.g. ). An alternative to Richard Murray's "control" package -- however, here we do not require Slycot.

Current capabilities:

1) Small signal analysis:
  a) Autovalues, autovector, participation factors, and mode shapes computation.


2) Publisher
  a) Generations of tables, figures, etc in restructuredtext format



How to install
--------------
Install using pypi, or direct from the Github repository:

1) Clone this repository somewhere convenient: `git clone https://github.com/jmmauricio/pypstools.git`
2) Install the package (we'll do a "develop" install, so any changes are immediately available):  `python setup.py develop` (you'll probably need to be administrator)
3) You're ready to go: try running the examples in the `example` folder.
