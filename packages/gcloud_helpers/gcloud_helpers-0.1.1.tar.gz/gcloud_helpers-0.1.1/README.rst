Helper Functions for the gcloud api

As of 2015/03/12, this only contains a helper for connecting to the
datastore. It can be pip installed by specifying the git repository (and
optionally, a hash). Also, the gcloud datastore API is being updated
pretty rapidly. This code works with gcloud version 0.4.0. If you update
this repo to work with a newer version of gcloud, make sure to update
requirements.txt
