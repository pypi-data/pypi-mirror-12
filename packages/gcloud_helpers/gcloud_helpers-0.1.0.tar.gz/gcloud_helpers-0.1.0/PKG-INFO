Description: # gcloud-helpers
        Helper Functions for the gcloud api
        
        As of 2015/03/12, this only contains a helper
        for connecting to the datastore. It can be pip installed
        by specifying the git repository (and optionally, a hash).
        Also, the gcloud datastore API is being updated pretty rapidly.
        This code works with gcloud version 0.4.0.
        If you update this repo to work
        with a newer version of gcloud, make sure to update
