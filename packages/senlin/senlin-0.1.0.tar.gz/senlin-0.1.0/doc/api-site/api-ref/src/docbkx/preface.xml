    <para>Use the OpenStack APIs and extensions to launch server

    <para>The API <emphasis role="bold">status</emphasis> reflects the
        state of the endpoint on the service. <emphasis role="bold"
            >CURRENT</emphasis> is a stable version that is
        up-to-date, recent, and might receive future versions. This
        endpoint should be prioritized over all others. <emphasis
            role="bold">SUPPORTED</emphasis> is a stable version that
        is available on the server. However, it is not likely the most
        recent available and might not be updated or might be
        deprecated at some time in the future. <emphasis role="bold"
            >DEPRECATED</emphasis> is a stable version that is still
        available but is being deprecated and might be removed in the
        future. <emphasis role="bold">EXPERIMENTAL</emphasis> is not a
        stable version. This version is under development or contains
        features that are otherwise subject to change. For more
