[Khan Academy](http://www.khanacademy.org/)'s core mission is to "provide a free world-class education for anyone anywhere", and as [60% of the world's population is without access to the internet](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Global_Internet_usage), primarily in the developing world, providing an alternative delivery mechanism for Khan Academy content is key to fulfilling this mission.

[KA Lite](https://learningequality.org/ka-lite/) is a lightweight [Django](https://www.djangoproject.com/) app for serving core Khan Academy content (videos and exercises) from a local server, with points and progress-tracking, without needing internet connectivity.

KA Lite is maintained by [Learning Equality](https://learningequality.org/), a small nonprofit startup based in San Diego.
