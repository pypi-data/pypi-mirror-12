# MagicLink {: .doctitle}
URL and email address auto-linking.

---

## Overview
GFM has a nice feature that detects and auto-generates links.  This extension adds similar functionality to Python Markdown allowing you to just type or paste links; no special syntax required.  It auto-links HTML, FTP, and email links.

## Examples

```
This requires no special syntax.

Just paste links directly in the document like this: https://github.com/facelessuser/pymdown-extensions.

Or even an email address fake.email@email.com.
