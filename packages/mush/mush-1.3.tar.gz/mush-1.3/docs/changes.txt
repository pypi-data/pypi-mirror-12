1.3 (21 October 2015)
---------------------

- Official support for Python 3.

- Drop official support for Windows, although things should still work.

- Move to Travis CI, Read The Docs and Coveralls for development.

- 'How' decorators like :func:`attr` and :func:`item` can now be nested
  as well as individually performing nested actions.

- Add :func:`returns` and :meth:`~Runner.add_returning` as new ways to
  override the type of a returned value.

- A better pattern for :ref:`marker types<marker-types>`.

1.2 (11 December 2013)
----------------------

- Use :obj:`nothing` instead of ``None`` for marker return types,
  fixing a bug that occurred when a callable tried to type-map a
  result that was ``None``.

- Add an :func:`after` type wrapper for callables that need to wait
  until after a resource is used but that can't accept that resource
  as a parameter.

1.1 (27 November 2013)
----------------------

- Allow runners to be instantiated using other runners.

- Allow :meth:`Runner.extend` to be passed :class:`Runner` instances.

- Allow :func:`requires` decorations to be stacked.

- Add a :meth:`Runner.replace` method to aid with testing assembled runners.

1.0 (29 October 2013)
