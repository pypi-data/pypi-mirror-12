Python interface to OpenFST
===========================

This package provides a Python extension module `fst` which exposes the [OpenFst](http://www.openfst.org/) [script-level](http://www.openfst.org/twiki/bin/view/FST/FstAdvancedUsage#FstScript) interface. Like the script-level interface, it supports arbitrary arcs and weights.

For more information, see the extension's [tutorial](http://python.openfst.org).

* 1.5.0 (2015-07-01): Initial release.

Troubleshooting
---------------

This module requires that you have installed OpenFst 1.5.0, which can be
obtained from the [official download page](http://openfst.org/twiki/bin/view/FST/FstDownload). It is also possible to install it by passing the `--enable-python` flag to the `configure` script and then running `make install`. This package is just another way to install the module.

This module may clash with the (unaffiliated) Python package called [pyfst](http://pyfst.github.io), as it also defines a module called `fst`. To avoid this clash, either uninstall pyfst, or keep the two packages in separate [virtual environments](http://docs.python-guide.org/en/latest/dev/virtualenvs/).
