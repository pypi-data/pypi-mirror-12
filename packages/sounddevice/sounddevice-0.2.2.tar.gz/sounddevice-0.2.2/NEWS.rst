Version 0.2.2 (2015-10-21):
 * Devices can now be selected by substrings of device name and host API name

Version 0.2.1 (2015-10-08):
 * Example applications ``wire.py`` (based on PortAudio's ``patest_wire.c``)
   and ``spectrogram.py`` (based on code by Mauris Van Hauwe)

Version 0.2.0 (2015-07-03):
 * Support for wheels including a dylib for Mac OS X and DLLs for Windows.
   The code for creating the wheels is largely taken from PySoundFile_.
 * Remove logging (this seemed too intrusive)
 * Return callback status from `sounddevice.wait()` and add the new function
   `sounddevice.get_status()`
 * `sounddevice.playrec()`: Rename the arguments *input_channels* and
   *input_dtype* to *channels* and *dtype*, respectively
