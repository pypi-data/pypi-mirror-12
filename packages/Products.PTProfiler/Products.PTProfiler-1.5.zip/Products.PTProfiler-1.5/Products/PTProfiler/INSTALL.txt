Installing PTProfiler

  Download the profiler package and unpack it in the Zope Products directory.
  The package should hook itself into the pagetemplate code without any
  modification. To enable profiling and view the results, place a 'PTProfiler
  Viewer' somewhere in the Zope tree (see also README.txt).

  Requirements:

    Zope 2.x (tested on Zope 2.5.x, 2.6.x, 2.7.x, and 2.8.x)
