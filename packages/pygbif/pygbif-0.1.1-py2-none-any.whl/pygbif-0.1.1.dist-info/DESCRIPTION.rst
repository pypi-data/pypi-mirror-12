`pygbif` is split up into modules for each of the major groups of API methods.

* Registry - Datasets, Nodes, Installations, Networks, Organizations
* Species - Taxonomic names
* Occurrences - Occurrence data, including the download API

You can import the entire library, or each module individually as needed.

Note that [GBIF maps API](http://www.gbif.org/developer/maps) is not included in `pygbif`.

```

## Species module

```python
from pygbif import species
species.name_suggest(q='Puma concolor')
