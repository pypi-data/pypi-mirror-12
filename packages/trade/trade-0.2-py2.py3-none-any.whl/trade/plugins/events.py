"""events: A default set of events for the trade module.

This plugin provides a standard set of events for the trade module.
Events are subclasses of trade.Occurrence. They are passed to
Accumulator and Porfolio objects to change asset accumulation data.

It contains the definitions of:
- Event
- StockSplit
- ReverseStockSplit
- BonusShares

Events can be accumulated by Portfolio objects just like any other
occurrence. Just like any other Occurrence subclass, each event must
for implement a update_container() method that receives a
trade.Accumulator object. This method will contain the logic for the
update on the accumulator data.
