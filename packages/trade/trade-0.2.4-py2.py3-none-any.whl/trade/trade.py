    This is achieved by calling this method:

    execute this tasks behind the scenes:

    - Execute all tasks defined in self.tasks. By default, no task is
      listed. Tasks are functions like this:
            def some_task(container)
      that receive an OperationContainer object and perform some work
      on the container data.

    - Create positions in self.positions for all operations in
      the container. Positions are all the operations with the same
      asset grouped in a single operation.
