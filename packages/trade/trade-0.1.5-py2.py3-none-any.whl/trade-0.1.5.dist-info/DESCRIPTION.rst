What is it?
-----------
trade is Python framework to ease the creation of investment management
applications. It is focused in, but not limited to, stock exchange markets.

The trade module provides notions of assets, purchases, sales, daytrades,
cost deduction, rates, options, option exercises, asset accumulation and more.

Installation
------------

The trade module can be installed with pip:

    pip install trade

To check if everything went OK, open the Python console and import the
module:

.. code:: python

    import trade
    asset = trade.Asset(symbol='AAPL')
    print(asset.symbol)
    #>> AAPL

Example
-------

A basic example of the trade module in action:

.. code:: python

    import trade

    # create the asset that we are going to trade
    asset = trade.Asset(name='Google Inc', symbol='GOOGL')

    # create the accumulator to accumulate trades with the asset
    accumulator = trade.Accumulator(asset)


    print(accumulator.asset.name)
    #>> Google Inc

    print(accumulator.quantity)
    #>> 0

    print(accumulator.price)
    #>> 0

    print(accumulator.results)
    #>> {'trades': 0}


    # create a trade operation buying the asset
    purchase = trade.Operation(
        asset=asset,
        quantity=10,
        price=650.73,
        date='2015-09-23'
    )

    # accumulate the trade
    accumulator.accumulate_operation(purchase)


    print(accumulator.quantity)
    #>> 10

    print(accumulator.price)
    #>> 650.73

    print(accumulator.results)
    #>> {'trades': 0}


    # create a new trade operation selling the asset
    sale = trade.Operation(
        asset=asset,
        quantity=-5,
        price=656.77,
        date='2015-09-24'
    )

    # accumulate the new trade
    accumulator.accumulate_operation(sale)


    print(accumulator.quantity)
    #>> 5

    print(accumulator.price)
    #>> 650.73

    print(accumulator.results)
    #>> {'trades': 30.199999999999818}

Operation objects may include rates and commissions that are considered
by the accumulator when it calculates results and average prices.

The Accumulator can also log the accumulated operations and their
results.

Check the `documentation`_ for all the available features.
