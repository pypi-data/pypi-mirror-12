"""options: Options plugin for the trade module.

This plugin provides Options functionalities to the trade module.

With this plugin you can:
- Create option assets that points to other (underlying) assets
- Create exercise operations that change both the option and underlying
  asset position on the portfolio

It provides:
- Option, a subclass of trade.Derivative
- Exercise, a subclass of trade.Operation
- the fetch_exercises() task to the OperationContainer
- the get_exercise_premium() task to the Portfolio
