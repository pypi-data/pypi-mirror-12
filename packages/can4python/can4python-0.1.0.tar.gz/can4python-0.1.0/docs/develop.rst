KCD file validation
-------------------
The KCD file format is described here: https://github.com/julietkilo/kcd

There is an example file as well as a XML schema definition file (.XSD format).

Use some online XML schema validator service to make sure the imported and exported KCD files to/from can4python are valid.


TODO
----
* Hosting documentation on suitable server
* Linking from PyPI
* Handle Labels (Enums) in KCD files.
* More usage examples, also with BCM.
