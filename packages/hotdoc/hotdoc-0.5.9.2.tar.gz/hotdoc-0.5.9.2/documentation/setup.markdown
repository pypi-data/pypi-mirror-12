# Installation guide

To install hotdoc, you will first need to satisfy the dependencies, on fedora 22 this can be done with:

sudo dnf install glib2-devel flex python-devel libxml2-devel libxslt-devel clang-devel

And on ubuntu:

sudo apt-get install python-dev libglib2.0-dev flex libxml2-dev libxslt1-dev libclang-3.5-dev

Adapt to your distribution.

You will also need to manually install the clang bindings adapted to your clang installation, for example if clang 3.5
is installed, you will need to run:

pip install clang==3.5

You can then install it through pypi with:

pip install hotdoc

It also works in a virtualenv.
