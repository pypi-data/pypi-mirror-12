Description: PyGoogleForm
        ============
        
        A simple Python library to submit Google Forms in Python.
        
        The goal is to be able to submit Google Forms from anything else than a
        web page (a Desktop app, or any device that doesn't use a browser).
        
        Installation
        ------------
        
        Clone the repository or install via PyPI (coming soon).
        
        How to use
        ----------
        
        1. Create your form in Google Form, and then click "view live form"
        2. Use the url of the page to initialize the GFParser
        
        ``python    import PyGoogleForm    url = "https://docs.google.com/forms/d/1jzDkEha066GwSCcSrCg1yaJJLpJAk0_aIFwf6GQgmmU/viewform"    gForm = PyGoogleForm.GFParser(url)``
        
        3. Get the questions by IDs
           ``python    questionIDs = gForm.getQuestionIDs()    question1 = gForm.getQuestionInfo(questionIDs[0])``
        
        4. Answer the question
           ``python    # question type    question1[1]    # question text    question[2]    # for radio, select or checkboxes, list of choices    question[3]    gForm.answerQuestion(question[0], "ok")``
        
        5. After answering all questions, submit the form
           ``python    gForm.submit()``
        
        Limitations
        -----------
        
        -  can handle only basic types: radio, select, checkbox, text, paragraph
           text
        -  doesn't support "required" answers. The form is submitted and the
           answer recorded in the answer sheet
        
        Licence
        -------
        
        The project uses a permissive MIT Licence. Do whatever you want with it.
