        Dependencies
        ============
        
        Python packages that the application depends on are listed in the
        ``requirements.txt`` file. Note that:
        
        -  The project uses Python 3, so you need to install Python 3 version of
           these dependencies (on Ubuntu 14.04 system you can do it by
           executing, e.g. ``sudo pip3 install pytest``).
        -  ``pyyaml`` package requires ``libyaml`` library to be installed in
           the system. On Ubuntu 14.04 system, this can be installed by running
           ``apt-get install libyaml-dev``
        
        Apart from that, `GraphViz <graphiz.org>`__ library has to be installed
        in the system. On Ubuntu 14.04 system, this can installed by running
        ``apt-get install graphviz``.
        
        Code development
        ================
        
        The **docstrings** in the code follow `Google style
        guide <https://google-styleguide.googlecode.com/svn/trunk/pyguide.html#Comments>`__
        with types declared in accordance to
        `Sphinx <http://sphinx-doc.org/>`__'s `type annotating
        conventions <http://sphinx-doc.org/latest/ext/example_google.html>`__.
        Note that you have to use Sphinx version at least 1.3 if you want to
        generate documentation with type annotations.
