tlslite-ng is a pure python implementation of SSLv3.0, TLS 1.0, TLS 1.1 and
TLS 1.2 protocols.

It can use pycrypto, m2crypto and gmp for acceleration of cryptographic
operations but is not dependant upon them.

Functionality implemented include:
 - RC4, 3DES-CBC, AES-CBC and AES-GCM ciphers
 - MD5, SHA1, SHA256 and SHA384 HMACs as well as AEAD mode of operation
 - RSA and DHE_RSA key exchange
 - anonymous DHE key exchange
 - NULL encryption ciphersuites
 - FALLBACK_SCSV
 - encrypt-then-MAC mode of operation for CBC ciphersuites
 - client certificates
 - TACK certificate pinning
 - SRP_SHA_RSA ciphersuites

tlslite-ng aims to be a drop-in replacement for tlslite while providing more
comprehensive set of features and more secure defautls.
