Description: 
        Instaclone is usually run from a directory where a instaclone.{yml,json}
        settings file resides. It will then install to and publish from that
        directory, based on settings in that file.
        
        Settings may be overridden with corresponding command-line args.
        
        The install method determines how items are installed from cache:
        - symlink: Symlink to read-only cache (the default)
        - copy: A slow, full copy of the file or directory
        - fastcopy: A faster copy using rsync (preferred over copy)
        - hardlink: A hard link (files only)
