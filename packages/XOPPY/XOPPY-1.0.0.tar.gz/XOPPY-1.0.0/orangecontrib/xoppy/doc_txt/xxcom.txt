==============================  Xxcom   =======================================

 Xxcom is a widget based graphical interface to calculate and display 
 photon cross sections. 

 It interfaces XCOM, a computer program and data base to calculate photon 
 cross sections for scattering, photoelectric absorption and pair production,
 as well as attenuation coefficients, in any element, compound or mixture,
 at energies from 1keV to 100GeV.

 The XCOM program has been written by M.J. Berger and J.H. Hubbell at NIST
 (see Help/Xcom).

 DESCRIPTION OF THE CONTROLS IN THE MAIN WINDOW:

  File:
    Xxcom input parameters: This option allows to save the current
		parameters to a file for later loading. It also allows
		to save the current parameters as defaults for being
		used when the application is initialized. In the last
		case, the file is named "application".xop (where 
		"application " is the name of the current XOP
		application) and is written in the directory pointed
		by the XOP_DEFAULTS_DIR environment variable (which
		must be set). The parameter file is ASCII and can be
		read and edited with care.
  Quit: to exit from the program

 Set_Parameters:
  Set Parameters: to define the parameters for the calculation.
		The same result is obtained pressing the "Set Parameters"
		button in the main Xxcom window. 
               Please refer to the information under the HELP
		button for a complete description of the parameters. After 
		pressing the ACCEPT button, xcom starts running.
  Set Defaults: Sets the default parameters.

  Show: Display results
    Plot Data: Shows the output data with the XPLOT
	facility. It is possible to switch between the output 
	quantities and to do a large number of operations and 
	display presentations by using the XPLOT controls
    Numerical Data: Displays the output file.

  Help:   Shows the xcom help and xxcom help (this text).
