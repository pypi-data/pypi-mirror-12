==============================  Xwiggler   ====================================

 Xwiggler is a widget based graphical interface to calculate
 the spectrum of a Wiggler Synchrotron Radiation source.

 The Flux and Spectral Power values calculated with XWiggler
 correspond to the integration in FULL vertical and horizontal 
 emission angles. 

 XWiggler calculations are done using the IDL program wiggler_spectrum. 
 This program is an IDL version of the Fortran program with the same 
 name available in the SHADOW ray-tracing package. 


 DESCRIPTION OF THE CONTROLS IN THE MAIN WINDOW:

  File:
    XWiggler input parameters: This option allows to save the current
		parameters to a file for later loading. It also allows
		to save the current parameters as defaults for being
		used when the application is initialized. In the last
		case, the file is named "application".xop (where 
		"application " is the name of the current XOP
		application) and is written in the directory pointed
		by the XOP_DEFAULTS_DIR environment variable (which
		must be set). The parameter file is ASCII and can be
		read and edited with care.
    Write Files for XOP/Optics: Saves the current undulator
		spectrum in the SRCOMPE (flux) and SRCOMPW (Power) files
		to be used for the other XOP application from Optics
		menu.
  Quit: to exit from the program

 Set_Parameters:
  K(gap) Tool: This tool permits to calculate the deflection
		parameter K as a function of the magnet gap.
  Set Parameters: to define the parameters for the calculation.
		The same result is obtained pressing the "Set Parameters"
		button in the main XWiggler window. 
               Please refer to the information under the HELP
		button for a complete description of the parameters. After 
		pressing the ACCEPT button, wiggler_spectrum starts running.
  Set Defaults: Sets the default parameters.

  Show: Display results
    Spectra: Plots the calculated wiggler spectra.
    Trajectories: Plots the calculated electron trajectories (individual paths
			and 3D view) 
    Parameters: Show the input parameters and some calculated values.

  Help:   Shows the XWiggler help (this text).
