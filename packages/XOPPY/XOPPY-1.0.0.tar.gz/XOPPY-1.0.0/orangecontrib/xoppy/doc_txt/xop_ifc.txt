   ===========================  xop_ifc   =========================

   xop_ifc is a generic widget based graphical interface.
   It allows to include xop-like interfaces in xop at run time.
   It reads the inputs from a file <application>.ifc which must be
   sitting in the $XOP_IFC directory or alternatively (is $XOP_IFC
   is undefined) in $XOP_HOME/ifc directory.

   See the file $XOP_HOME/ifc/mlayer.ifc as an example of how to write
   these files.

       Modification history:
	97-09-12 srio@esrf.fr makes no_block keyword. Adds the option
	  state.ifc.run='<none>' to avoid spawning (to be used in 
	  applications fully written in IDL). Uses $XOP_IFC as a 
	  directory from where the *.ifc file is read. If $XOP_IFC
	  is not set, uses $XOP_HOME/ifc. xop_ifc_run accepts
	  now 21 (a0,...,a20) generic variables... Use of sdep.pro
	  for getting system dependencies.
	97-11-07 srio@esrf.fr ifc files are in $XOP_HOME/ifc and not
	  longer in $XOP_HOME/data.
	97-11-07 srio@esrf.fr fixes a bug when loading/writing files. 
	98-11-04 srio@esrf.fr uses Catch.
	98-11-24 srio@esrf.fr changes to new input file system (xop2.0)
	00-07-17 srio@esrf.fr the tags nrows and ncol in the ifc
		structure are now optional. One of them must be set.
	02-05-23 srio@esrf.fr bug fixed: writes to a file the correct 
		version (not 1.0). Added optional input ifc to xop_ifc_run
