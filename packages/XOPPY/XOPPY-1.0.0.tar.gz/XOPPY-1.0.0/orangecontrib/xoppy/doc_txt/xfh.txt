==================================  xfh      ==================================

 XFH is a widget based graphical interface to calculate structure
 factor of crystals.

 The data are taken from the DABAX data base.

 It access the following DABAX files:
	CrystalStructures.dat
	CrystalCell.dat
	f1f2_*.dat
	f0_CromerMann.dat,f0_CromerMann_old1968.dat,f0_WaasKirf.dat


 CUSTOMIZATION OF XFH INPUT PARAMETERS:
  -If you want to add(remove) another f1f2* file, just add(remove) it
   in any(all) directory of $DABAX_PATH. 
  -If you want to add(remove) another f0 file, follow the inscructions
	given before.
  -If you want to modify the crystal list, do the following:
        a) copy the CrystalStructures.dat and CrystalCell.dat files to
           a given directory (i.e. current directory ".")
        b) Modify these files to add/remove/change the entries. Both
	    files must have the same entries (or "scans").
        c) Redefine $DABAX_PATH to include your new directoty:
           setenv  DABAX_PATH = .:$DABAX_PATH
        d) Restart the application.

 DESCRIPTION OF THE CONTROLS IN THE MAIN WINDOW:

  File:
    Xfh input parameters: This option allows to save the current
		parameters to a file for later loading. It also allows
		to save the current parameters as defaults for being
		used when the application is initialized. In the last
		case, the file is named "application".xop (where 
		"application " is the name of the current XOP
		application) and is written in the directory pointed
		by the XOP_DEFAULTS_DIR environment variable (which
		must be set). The parameter file is ASCII and can be
		read and edited with care.
  Quit: to exit from the program

 Set_Parameters:
  Set Parameters: to define the parameters for the calculation.
		The same result is obtained pressing the "Set Parameters"
		button in the main Xfh window. 
               Please refer to the information under the HELP
		button for a complete description of the parameters. After 
		pressing the ACCEPT button, xfh starts running and
		creates a graphical window with the results.
  Set Defaults: Sets the default parameters.

  Show: Diaplay results
    Plot crystal parameters: performs a plot of the energy-dependent parameters
		(this option os only available for a number of energy points 
		 nonequal to one)
    Show crystal parameters: Show text information of the crystal parameters
    Show crystallographic parameters: Show parameters used to build the 
		structure factor. 
  Help:   Shows the xfh help (this text).
