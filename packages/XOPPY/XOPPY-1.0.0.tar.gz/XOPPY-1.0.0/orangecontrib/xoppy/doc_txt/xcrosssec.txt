==================================  XCrossSec      ============================

 XCrossSec is a widget based graphical interface to calculate Photon-Atom
 Cross Sections, Mass Absorption Coefficients amd Liner Absorption Coeff.
 for elements, compounds and mixtures.
 The data are taken from the DABAX data base. 
 It uses the following DABAX files:
    CrossSec_*.dat  (for tabulated Cross Sections. 
                       Presently *={EPDL,XCOM,McMaster}
    Compounds.dat   (for mixture and compounds list)
    AtomicConstants.dat (for atomic Mass and Density)

 Possible calculations:
	Cross Section [barn/atom]
	Cross Section [cm^2]
	Mass Absorption Coefficient [cm^2/g]
	Linear Absorption Coefficient [cm^-1]
	Energy Transfer (Linear and Mass) Coeff [cm^2/g,cm^-1]: This 
	 option is only allowed by using the DABAX file 
	 CrossSec_EDPL.dat, where these values are tabulated. 
	 See doc on this file for additional information.


 CUSTOMIZATION OF XCROSSSEC INPUT PARAMETERS:
  -If you want to add(remove) another CrossSec_* file, just add(remove) it
	in any(all) directory of $DABAX_PATH. Note that the CrossSec
	files containing all the partial cross section (the ones used
	here) only have a single underscore (_). 
 -If you want to modify the mixture table  list, do the following:
     > a) copy the Compounds.dat DABAX file to a given directory 
	(e.g., current directory ".")
     > b) Modify this file to add/remove/change the entries.
     > c) Redefine $DABAX_PATH to include your new directoty:
	setenv  DABAX_PATH = .:$DABAX_PATH
     > d) Restart the application.


 DESCRIPTION OF THE CONTROLS IN THE MAIN WINDOW:

  File:
    XCrossSec input parameters: This option allows to save the current
		parameters to a file for later loading. It also allows
		to save the current parameters as defaults for being
		used when the application is initialized. In the last
		case, the file is named "application".xop (where 
		"application " is the name of the current XOP
		application) and is written in the directory pointed
		by the XOP_DEFAULTS_DIR environment variable (which
		must be set). The parameter file is ASCII and can be
		read and edited with care.
  Quit: to exit from the program

 Set_Parameters:
  Set Parameters: to define the parameters for the calculation.
		The same result is obtained pressing the "Set Parameters"
		button in the main XCrossSec window. 
               Please refer to the information under the HELP
		button for a complete description of the parameters. After 
		pressing the ACCEPT button, xcrosssec starts running and
		creates a graphic window with the results.
  Set Defaults: Sets the default parameters.

  Help:   Shows the XCrossSec help (this text).
