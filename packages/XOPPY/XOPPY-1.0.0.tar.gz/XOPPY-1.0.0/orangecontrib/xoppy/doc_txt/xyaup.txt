==============================  Xyaup   =======================================

  Xyaup is a widget based graphical interface to calculate spectra of a 
  tapered undulator insertion devices.

  It interfaces the program YAUP 1.3.1 written by B. Boyanov (see Help/Yaup)


 DESCRIPTION OF THE CONTROLS IN THE MAIN WINDOW:

  File:
    XYaup input parameters: This option allows to save the current
		parameters to a file for later loading. It also allows
		to save the current parameters as defaults for being
		used when the application is initialized. In the last
		case, the file is named "application".xop (where 
		"application " is the name of the current XOP
		application) and is written in the directory pointed
		by the XOP_DEFAULTS_DIR environment variable (which
		must be set). The parameter file is ASCII and can be
		read and edited with care.
    Yaup file: This option allows to load/write the current parameter
		and result files for further calculations. The used file
		formats are those used by YAUP. Therefore, they
		can be used to run YAUP without the interface or to
		import YAUP files created outside the XYAUP application.
    Write Files for XOP/Optics: Saves the current undulator
		spectrum in the SRCOMPE (flux) and SRCOMPW (Power) files
		to be used for the other XOP application from Optics
		menu.
  Quit and preserve files: Quits without cleaning current directory
		(i.e., preserving the created data files.)
  Quit: to exit from the program

 BField:
         	from ASCII file: 
		Yaup needs a file with tha magnetic field. This may be 
		obtain from a user's file (column-formatted, containing
		three colums: z, B(z), and phi(z), where the z s are 
		equidistant with step PERIOD/NPTS. 
		See Help/Yaup for definitions of PERIOD and NPTS.  
		There should be NPTS*NPER+1 lines in the ASCII file.

		from XBFIELD Preprocessor: calls XBFIELD, an interface for the 
		program BFIELD distributed in the YAUP package. This program
		creates the magnetic field starting from the undulator
		oparameters.

		from Linear B field: Creates a magnetic field modulated with a 
		straight line with the given B or K extrema.

 Set_Parameters:
  Set Parameters: to define the parameters for the calculation.
		The same result is obtained pressing the "Set Parameters"
		button in the main XYAUP window. 
               Please refer to the information under the HELP
		button for a complete description of the parameters. After 
		pressing the ACCEPT button, YAUP starts running.
  Set Defaults: Sets the default parameters.

  Show: Display results
		Plot B field: Plots the computed B field.
		Plot Trajectory: Plots the electron trajectory in the 
		defined magnetic field.
		Show Trajectory Numerical Data: display the trajectory 
		output file.
		Plot Results: Makes 2-D or 3-D plots of the results,
		depending on the mode and other defined parameters.
		Show Results Numerical Data: display the yaup result file.

  Help:   Shows the YAUP help and the XYAUP help (this text).
