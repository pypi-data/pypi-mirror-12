==============================  Xbfield   =====================================

   Xbfield is an widget based graphical interface to calculate 
   field of an tappered undulator insertion devices.

************************* IMPORTANT NOTICE ************************************
   This utility (coming with the YAUP distribution), in the tapered case, 
   generates a B field assumed be an amplitude-modulated sinusoid, e.g.
   Btot(z) = B(z)*sin(2*pi/period*z) and a linearly modulated gap is 
   assumed.  DG is the degree of gap taper:
   gap=gzmin*(1.0+z*dg/ulen)
   r=gap/per
   ampl=0.95*3.44*exp(-r*(5.08-1.54*r)) (for Nb-Fe-B magnets) or
   ampl=0.95*3.33*exp(-r*(5.47-1.80*r)) (for Sm-Co magnets). This
   approximation comes from "6 GeV Synchrotron X-ray Source, Conceptual
   Design Report Supplement A", LS-52, Argonne National Laboratory,
   (March 1986), and you can also find it in the ESRF Foundation Phase
   Report (The red book), pag CIV-314
   
   If these parameters does not fit with the user's requirements, then
   the user should either customize it or create another bfield 
   program which writes the output magnetic field in the format 
   accepted by yaup.

 DESCRIPTION OF THE CONTROLS IN THE MAIN WINDOW:

  File:
    XBField input parameters: This option allows to save the current
		parameters to a file for later loading. It also allows
		to save the current parameters as defaults for being
		used when the application is initialized. In the last
		case, the file is named "application".xop (where 
		"application " is the name of the current XOP
		application) and is written in the directory pointed
		by the XOP_DEFAULTS_DIR environment variable (which
		must be set). The parameter file is ASCII and can be
		read and edited with care.
  Quit: to exit from the program

 Set_Parameters:
  Set Parameters: to define the parameters for the calculation.
		The same result is obtained pressing the "Set Parameters"
		button in the main XBField window. 
               Please refer to the information under the HELP
		button for a complete description of the parameters. After 
		pressing the ACCEPT button, BFIELD starts running.
  Set Defaults: Sets the default parameters.

  Show: Display results
    Plot Results: Plots the BFIELD results.
    Show Numerical Results: Displays the BFIELD result file.

  Help:   Shows the BFIELD help and the XBFIELD help (this text).
