==============================  Xinpro   ======================================

 Xinpro is a widget based graphical interface to calculate perfect crystal
 reflectivity profiles. 

 It interfaced the inpro (INtrinsic PROfiles) code. Inpro calculates the 
 diffracted and transmitted profiles in reflection (Bragg) and transmission 
 (Laue) geometries for plane perfect crystals. 

 DESCRIPTION OF THE CONTROLS IN THE MAIN WINDOW:

  File:
    Xinpro input parameters: This option allows to save the current
		parameters to a file for later loading. It also allows
		to save the current parameters as defaults for being
		used when the application is initialized. In the last
		case, the file is named "application".xop (where 
		"application " is the name of the current XOP
		application) and is written in the directory pointed
		by the XOP_DEFAULTS_DIR environment variable (which
		must be set). The parameter file is ASCII and can be
		read and edited with care.
  Quit: to exit from the program

 Set_Parameters:
  Set Parameters: to define the parameters for the calculation.
		The same result is obtained pressing the "Set Parameters"
		button in the main Xinpro window. 
               Please refer to the information under the HELP
		button for a complete description of the parameters. After 
		pressing the ACCEPT button, inpro starts running.
  Set Defaults: Sets the default parameters.

  Show: Display results
    Diffraction curves: Plots the inpro results.
    parameters: Displays some outputs from inpro.dat

  Help:   Shows the Xinpro help (this text).
