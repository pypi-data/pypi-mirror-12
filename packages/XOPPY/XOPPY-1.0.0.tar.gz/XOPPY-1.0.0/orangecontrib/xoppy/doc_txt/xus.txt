===============================  Xus   ========================================

   Xus is an widget based graphical user interface to calculate 
   spectral properties of ideal undulator insertion devices.

 DESCRIPTION OF THE CONTROLS IN THE MAIN WINDOW:

  File:
    Xus input parameters: This option allows to save the current
		parameters to a file for later loading. It also allows
		to save the current parameters as defaults for being
		used when the application is initialized. In the last
		case, the file is named "application".xop (where 
		"application " is the name of the current XOP
		application) and is written in the directory pointed
		by the XOP_DEFAULTS_DIR environment variable (which
		must be set). The parameter file is ASCII and can be
		read and edited with care.
    US file: This option allows to load/write the current parameter
		and result files for further calculations. The used file
		formats are those used by US. Therefore, they
		can be used to run US without the interface or to
		import US files created outside the XUS application.
    Write Files for XOP/Optics: Saves the current undulator
		spectrum in the SRCOMPE (flux) and SRCOMPW (Power) files
		to be used for the other XOP application from Optics
		menu.
  Quit: to exit from the program

 Set_Parameters:
  Set Parameters: to define the parameters for the calculation.
		The same result is obtained pressing the "Set Parameters"
		button in the main XUS window. 
		After pressing the ACCEPT button, US starts running.
  Set Defaults: Sets the default parameters.

  Show: Display results
    Plot ...: Plots the US results.
    View Results: Displays the US result file.

  Help:   Shows the US help and the XUS help (this text).

  KNOWN BUGS:
       When a US calculation producing 3D results is run, the Show/Plot 2D
	menu gives wrong results (MSR 98-12-04).
