 =================================  xf1f2      ============================

 xf1f2 is a widget based graphical interface to calculate Elastic
 Anomalous Photon-Atom Scattering, and their derived parameters
 (refraction index, photoelectric absorption, reflectivity).

 ** VERY IMPORTANT **

 PLEASE NOTE THAT XF1F2 APPLICATION DOES NOT INCLUDE COMPTON SCATTERING
 CALCULATIONS. IF FOR YOUR CALCULATIONS COMPTON IS IMPORTANT, PLEASE
 USE XCROSSSEC OR XPOWER APPLICATIONS.
 THIS AFFECTS THE VALUES: BETA, MU, CROSS SECTION AND DELTA/BETA


		Practical tip: 

		For cross section, scattering factors and reflectivity, use
		    xf1f2 and try to define your material in molecular
		    form. 
		For calculating attenuation coefficients, beta and cross
                   sections use xCrossSec (and not xf1f2) because:
		    i) it is more accurate in case of defining the material
			by its weight fractions.
		    ii) it used all channels in the attenuation (contrary to 
		        xf1f2 that only uses photoelectron cross section). 


 The data are taken from the DABAX data base.

 Possible calculations:
	       f1
	       f2
	       delta [n=1-delta-i beta]
	       betaPh [n=1-delta-i beta, betaPh is the Photoelectric component]
	       Photoelectric linear abs coeff (mu [cm^-1)]
	       Photoelectric mass  abs coeff (mu [cm^2/g)]
	       Photoelectric Cross Section [barns]
	       s-pol reflectivity
	       p-pol reflectivity
	       unpolarized reflectivity
              delta/betaPh (delta/beta from Photoelectric interaction only)


 CUSTOMIZATION OF Xf1f2 DABAX INPUT PARAMETERS:
  -If you want to add(remove) another f1f2* file, just add(remove) it
   in any(all) directory of $DABAX_PATH. 
 -If you want to modify the mixture table  list, do the following:
     a) copy the Compounds.dat DABAX file to a given directory 
        (e.g., current directory ".")
     b) Modify this file to add/remove/change the entries.
     c) Redefine $DABAX_PATH to include your new directoty:
        setenv  DABAX_PATH = .:$DABAX_PATH
     d) Restart the application.


 DESCRIPTION OF THE CONTROLS IN THE MAIN WINDOW:

  File:
    Xf1f2 input parameters: This option allows to save the current
		parameters to a file for later loading. It also allows
		to save the current parameters as defaults for being
		used when the application is initialized. In the last
		case, the file is named "application".xop (where 
		"application " is the name of the current XOP
		application) and is written in the directory pointed
		by the XOP_DEFAULTS_DIR environment variable (which
		must be set). The parameter file is ASCII and can be
		read and edited with care.
  Quit: to exit from the program

 Set_Parameters:
  Set Parameters: to define the parameters for the calculation.
		The same result is obtained pressing the "Set Parameters"
		button in the main Xf1f2 window. 
               Please refer to the information under the HELP
		button for a complete description of the parameters. After 
		pressing the ACCEPT button, xf1f2 start running and
		presents a graphic display with results.
  Set Defaults: Sets the default parameters.

  Help:   Shows the xf1f2 help (this text).
