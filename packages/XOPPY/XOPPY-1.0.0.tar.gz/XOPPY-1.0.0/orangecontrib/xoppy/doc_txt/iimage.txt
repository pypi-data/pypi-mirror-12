 NAME:
   iImage

 PURPOSE:
   Implements the iimage wrapper interface for the tools sytem.

 CALLING SEQUENCE:
   iImage[, Image][,X, Y]

 INPUTS:
    Image   - Either a vector, two-dimensional array, or
      three-dimensional array representing the sample values to be
      displayed as an image.

      If Image is a vector:
        The X and Y arguments must also be present and contain the same
        number of elements.  In this case, a dialog will be presented that
        offers the option of gridding the data to a regular grid (the
        results of which will be displayed as a color-indexed image).

      If Image is a two-dimensional array:
        If either dimension is 3:
          Image represents an array of XYZ values (either:
          [[x0,y0,z0],[x1,y1,z1],.], or [[x0,x1,.],[y0,y1,.],[z0,z1,.]]).
          In this case, the X and Y arguments, if present, will be ignored.
          A dialog will be presented that allows the option of gridding the
          data to a regular grid (the results of which will be displayed as
          a color-indexed image, using the Z values as the image data
          values).

        If neither dimension is 3:
          If X and Y are provided, the sample values are defined as a
          function of the corresponding (X, Y) locations; otherwise, the
          sample values are implicitly treated as a function of the array
          indices of each element of Image.

      If Image is a three-dimensional array:
        If one of the dimensions is 3:
          Image is an array (3xMxN, or Mx3xN, or MxNx3) representing the
          red, green, and blue channels of the RGB image to be displayed.

        If one of the dimensions is 4:
          Image is an array (4xMxN, or Mx4xN, or MxNx4) representing the
          red, green, blue, and alpha channels of the RGBA image to be
          displayed.
    X       - Either a vector or a two-dimensional array representing the
      X coordinates of the image grid.

      If the Image argument is a vector:
        X must be a vector with the same number of elements.

      If the Image argument is a two-dimensional array (for which neither
      dimension is 3):
        If X is a vector, each element of X specifies the X coordinates for
        a column of Image (e.g., X[0] specifies the X coordinate for
        Image[0, *]).
        If X is a two-dimensional array, each element of X specifies the
        X coordinate of the corresponding point in Image (Xij specifies the
        X coordinate of Imageij).

      If the Image argument is a three-dimensional RGB or RGBA array:
        X is a vector where each element specifies the X coordinate for
        a row of Image (e.g., X[0] specifies the X coordinate for
        Image[*,0,*]).

    Y      - Either a vector or a two-dimensional array representing the
      Y coordinates of the image grid.

      If the Image argument is a vector:
        Y must be a vector with the same number of elements.

      If the Image argument is a two-dimensional array:
        If Y is a vector, each element of Y specifies the Y coordinates for
        a column of Image (e.g., Y[0] specifies the Y coordinate for
        Image[*,0]).
        If Y is a two-dimensional array, each element of Y specifies the Y
        coordinate of the corresponding point in Image (Yij specifies the
        Y coordinate of Imageij).

      If the Image argument is a three-dimensional RGB or RGBA array:
        Y is a vector where each element specifies the Y coordinate for
        a column of Image (e.g., Y[0] specifies the Y coordinate for
        Image[*,*,0]).

 KEYWORD PARAMETERS:

    ALPHA_CHANNEL - Set this keyword to a two-dimensional array
      representing the alpha channel pixel values for the image to
      be displayed.  This keyword is ignored if the Image argument is
      present, and is intended to be used in conjunction with some
      combination of the RED_CHANNEL, GREEN_CHANNEL, and BLUE_CHANNEL
      keywords.

    BLUE_CHANNEL - Set this keyword to a two-dimensional array
      representing the blue channel pixel values for the image to
      be displayed.  This keyword is ignored if the Image argument is
      present, and is intended to be used in conjunction with some
      combination of the ALPHA_CHANNEL, RED_CHANNEL, and GREEN_CHANNEL
      keywords.

    GREEN_CHANNEL - Set this keyword to a two-dimensional array
      representing the green channel pixel values for the image to
      be displayed.  This keyword is ignored if the Image argument is
      present, and is intended to be used in conjunction with some
      combination of the ALPHA_CHANNEL, RED_CHANNEL, and BLUE_CHANNEL
      keywords.

    IDENTIFIER  [out] - The identifier of the created tool.

    IMAGE_LOCATION - Set this keyword to a two-element vector, [x,y],
      specifying the location of the lower-left corner of the image
      in data units.  The default is [0,0].

    IMAGE_DIMENSIONS - Set this keyword to a two-element vector,
      [width,height], specifying the dimensions of the image in
      data units.  The default is the pixel dimensions of the image.

    RED_CHANNEL - Set this keyword to a two-dimensional array
      representing the red channel pixel values for the image to be
      displayed.  This keyword is ignored if the Image argument is
      present, and is intended to be used in conjunction with some
      combination of the ALPHA_CHANNEL, GREEN_CHANNEL, and BLUE_CHANNEL
      keywords.

   RGB_TABLE - Set this keyword to the number of the predefined IDL color
       table (0 to 40), or to a 3x256 or 256x3 byte array of RGB color values.
       If no color tables are supplied, the tool will provide a
       default 256-entry linear grayscale ramp.

    All other keywords are passed to the tool during creation.

 MODIFICATION HISTORY:
   Written by:  CT, RSI, March 2002
   Modified: CT, Nov 2006: Allow X and Y params with RGB and RGBA images.
       Add TEST keyword, allow RGB_TABLE to be a Loadct table number.
