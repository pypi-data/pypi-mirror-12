This is a description of the input parameters for xf0

datasets: 
	Select a DABAX file from where the f0 scattering factors
	will be read. The "all" option is also available, and 
	in this case all datasets are used (useful for comparisons).

material: Select the desired material type. Three options are available:
	a) Element(formula) calculation for a single element. 
	b) Mixture(formula) calculation for a compound or a mixture. The user 
		defines the mixture formula. 
		The syntaxis is the following: string with the chemical
		formula of the compound(s) with their weight fraction between 
		parenthesis.
		Examples:
		H20
		SiO2(0.807)B2O3(0.129)Na2O(0.038)Al2O3(0.022)K2O(0.004)
		H2O(0.99)Cl2(0.01)
		H(0.11189834)O(0.88810166)
	c) Mixture(table) calculation for a compound or a mixture defined
		in the included mixture-table (from dabax file Compounds.dat)

table: Compound table, only available if the c) option in material is chosen.

formula: The element or compound or mixture formula, depending the "material"
		selection.

sin_theta/lambda [A**(-1)] grid: the abscissas values for the calculations. Two 
		options are available: 
		a) Standard, 515 points in the [0,8] interval.
		b) User-defined, with the parameters described below.

Form : the initial abscissa value (only available if b) is chosen)

To: the last abscissas value (only available if b) is chosen)

Number of points: the number of energy points (only available if b) is 
		chosen in the "sin_theta/lambda grid" entry.
