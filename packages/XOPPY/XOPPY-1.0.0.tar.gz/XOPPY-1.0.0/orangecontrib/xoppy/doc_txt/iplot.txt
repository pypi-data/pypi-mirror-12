 NAME:
   IPLOT

 PURPOSE:
   Fire up the plot iTool.

 CALLING SEQUENCE:
   IPLOT, [[x],y] (for 2D plot)
 OR
   IPLOT, x,y,z (for 3D plot)

 INPUTS:

 KEYWORD PARAMETERS:

   SCATTER
   Set this keyword to generate a scatter plot.  This is equivalent
   to setting LINESTYLE=6 (no line) and SYM_INDEX=3 (Period symbol).

   [XYZ]ERROR
   Set this keyword to either a vector or a 2xN array of error
   values to be displayed as error bars for the [XYZ] dimension
   of the plot.  The length of this array must be equal in length
   to the number of vertices of the plot or it will be ignored.
   If the value is a vector, the value will be applied as both a
   negative and positive error and the error bar will be symmetric
   about the plot vertex.  If the value is a 2xN array the [0,*]
   values define the negative error and the [1,*] values define
   the positive error, allowing asymmetric error bars.;

   RGB_TABLE
   Set this keyword to the number of the predefined IDL color table (0 to 40),
   or to either a 3 by 256 or 256 by 3 byte array containing color values
   to use for vertex colors. If the values supplied are not of type byte,
   they are scaled to the byte range using BYTSCL. Use the VERT_COLORS
   keyword to specify indices that select colors from the values specified
   with RGB_TABLE.

   VERT_COLORS
   Set this keyword to a vector of indices into the color table
   to select colors to use for vertex colors or a 3xN or 4xN array of
   colors values to use directly.  If the number of indices or
   colors is less than the number of vertices, the colors are
   repeated cyclically.

 MODIFICATION HISTORY:
   Written by:  CT, RSI, March 2002
   Modified:    AY, RSI, February 2003: Update to allow 3D data
   Modified: CT, Oct 2006: Added helper function, TEST keyword,
       allow RGB_TABLE to be a Loadct table number.
