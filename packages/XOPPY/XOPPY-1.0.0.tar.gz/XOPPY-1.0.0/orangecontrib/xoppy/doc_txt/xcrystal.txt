=================================   xcrystal   ================================


   Xcrystal is a widget based graphical interface to calculate diffraction
   profiles of perfect and mosaic crystals. It allows Bragg and Laue
   geometries and (in the case of perfect crystals) diffracted and
   transmitted intensity calculations.  The diffracted intensity can be
   calculated as a function of either rock angle or photon energy.
   It uses the DABAX database to define the crystal structure and to 
   retrieve the scattering factors to build the crystal structure factors.

   It interfaces diff_pat, a computer program written by M. Sanchez del Rio
   (srio@esrf.fr) derived from the SHADOW application bragg.


 DESCRIPTION OF THE CONTROLS IN THE MAIN WINDOW:

  File:
    Xcrystal input parameters: This option allows to save the current
		parameters to a file for later loading. It also allows
		to save the current parameters as defaults for being
		used when the application is initialized. In the last
		case, the file is named "application".xop (where 
		"application " is the name of the current XOP
		application) and is written in the directory pointed
		by the XOP_DEFAULTS_DIR environment variable (which
		must be set). The parameter file is ASCII and can be
		read and edited with care.
  Quit: to exit from the program

 Set_Parameters:
  Set Parameters: to define the parameters for the calculation.
		The same result is obtained pressing the "Set Parameters"
		button in the main XCrystal window. 
               Please refer to the information under the HELP
		button for a complete description of the parameters. After 
		pressing the ACCEPT button, diff_pat starts running.
  Set Defaults: Sets the default parameters.

  Show: Display results
   Diffraction Curve: starts a graphical window with the calculation results.
   Crystal Parameters: shows output parameters of the calculation.
   Crystallographic Parameters: shows numerical values used to build the 
		crystal structure factor.

  Help:   Shows the xcrystal help (this text).
