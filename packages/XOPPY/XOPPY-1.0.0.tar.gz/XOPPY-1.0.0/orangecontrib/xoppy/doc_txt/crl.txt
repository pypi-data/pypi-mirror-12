==================================   CRL   ====================================


   CRL is an widget based graphical interface to calculate the parameters
   of Compound Refractive Lenses (CRL).

   Two kind of calculations are allowed:
	i) main parameters (focal distances, gain, acceptance, etc.)
	   (calculated using Refs. 1 & 2)
	ii) Pseudo-Ray-Tracing to compute the beam profile at the image
	    plane and the phase-space plot. 
	   (calculated using Ref. 2, formulas 9 and 32 for cylindrical 
	    and parabolic lenses, respectively).

 DESCRIPTION OF THE CONTROLS IN THE MAIN WINDOW:

  File:
    CRL input parameters: This option allows to save the current
		parameters to a file for later loading. It also allows
		to save the current parameters as defaults for being
		used when the application is initialized. In the last
		case, the file is named "application".xop (where 
		"application " is the name of the current XOP
		application) and is written in the directory pointed
		by the XOP_DEFAULTS_DIR environment variable (which
		must be set). The parameter file is ASCII and can be
		read and edited with care.
  Quit: to exit from the program

 Set_Parameters:
  Set Parameters: to define the parameters for the calculation.
		The same result is obtained pressing the "Set Parameters"
		button in the main CRL window. 
               Please refer to the information under the HELP
		button for a complete description of the parameters. After 
		pressing the "GO CALCULATE" button, CRL starts running.
		Note that, differently from most of other XOP applications, 
		this "Set Parameters" window is a non-modal window.
  Set Defaults: Sets the default parameters.

  Help:   Shows the CRL help (this text).
