Description of the input parameters for BM:
===========================================

MAGNETIC FIELD three posibilities:
  Sinusoidal or standard wiggler
  Asymmetric wiggler with magnetic field profile (for a single priod) 
    from a two columns file (y[meters], B[Tesla])
    An example of this option can be found in the files ex3_b.dat
	in the $XOP_HOME/examples directory.
  Asymmetric wiggler with magnetic field calculated in function of a 
    supplied file containing the harmonic expansion of the magnetic field 
    profile. The file contains two columns: (# of harmonic, Bmax [T])
    An example of this option can be found in the files ex3_b.dat
    in the $XOP_HOME/examples directory.
NUMBER OF PERIODS of the Wiggler
WIGGLER PERIOD in meters
K VALUE
BEAM ENERGY of the electrons in GeV
MINIMUM PHOTON ENERGY for the calculation in eV
MAXIMUM PHOTON ENERGY for the calculation in eV
NUMBER OF ENERGY POINTS
ENERGY POINT SPACING: Sel linear of logatithmic for the corresponding 
	energy point spacing
NUMBER OF TRAJECTORY POINTS PER PERIOD of electron trajectory
ELECTRON BEAM INTENSITY in mA
