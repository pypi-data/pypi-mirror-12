 NEUTRON REACTOR SPECTRA a widget based graphical interface to calculate the 
 neutron spectrum from a reactor as a function of the neutron energy. 

 DESCRIPTION OF THE CONTROLS IN THE MAIN WINDOW:

 File:
   NSources input parameters: This option allows to save the current
	parameters to a file for later loading. It also allows to save 
	the current parameters as defaults for being used when the 
	application is initialised. In the last case, the file is named 
	"application".xop (where "application" is the name of the current 
	XOP application: nsources) and is written in the directory pointed 
	by the XOP_DEFAULTS_DIR environment variable (which must be set). 
	The parameter file is ASCII and can be read and edited with care.
   Quit: to exit from the program

Set_Parameters:
   Set Parameters: to define the parameters for the calculation. The same 
	result is obtained pressing the "Set Parameters" button in the main  
	distribution window. 
   Set Defaults: Sets the default parameters.

Show: Display results
   Plot Results: Plots the reactor spectra results: 
   View Results: Displays the outputs.

Help: Shows the NSOURCES (NEUTRON REACTOR SPECTRA) help (this text).

METHOD: 
   Thermal neutron flux is a Maxwellian distribution valid for E < 0.2 eV
   Epithermal neutron flux is proportional to 1/energy and is valid for 
	0.2 eV < E < 0.5 MeV
   Fast neutron flux, valid for E > 0.5 MeV and proportional to 
	exp(-E sinh( Sqrt(2E)))
