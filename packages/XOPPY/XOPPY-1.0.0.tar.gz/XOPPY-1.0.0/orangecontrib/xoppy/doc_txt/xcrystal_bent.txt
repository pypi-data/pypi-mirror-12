=============================   Xcrystal_bent   ===============================


  Xcrystal_bent is a common widget based graphical interface to different
  codes that perform curved crystal diffraction calculations.

  The idea is to perform bent crystal calculations with different
  modules (computer codes) using the same interface. The different 
  modules use different theories. The initial considered theories are:

  1) Lamellar theory.  
  2) Penning Polder theory.  
  3) Takagi-Taupin theory. 
  In addition, and for comparison purposes, a module to calculate
  flat perfect crystals, based on the Zachariasen's theory has been
  included. For FLAT crystals calculations it is recommended to use
  the xcrystal application in XOP>

  Plase note that:
    The Penning-Polder model is only available for LAUE crystals
    The Takagi-Taupin model is under testing for BRAGG crystals, and
	it may not produce correct results.

  XCrystal_bent uses the codes crystal_za (Zachariasen), crystal_ml 
  (Multi-lamellar) crystal_pp (Penning-Polder) and crystal_tt (Takagi-Taupin).


 DESCRIPTION OF THE CONTROLS IN THE MAIN WINDOW:

  File:
    xcrystal_bent input parameters: This option allows to save the current
		parameters to a file for later loading. It also allows
		to save the current parameters as defaults for being
		used when the application is initialized. In the last
		case, the file is named "application".xop (where 
		"application " is the name of the current XOP
		application) and is written in the directory pointed
		by the XOP_DEFAULTS_DIR environment variable (which
		must be set). The parameter file is ASCII and can be
		read and edited with care.
  Quit: to exit from the program

 Set_Parameters:
  Set Parameters: to define the parameters for the calculation.
		The same result is obtained pressing the "Set Parameters"
		button in the main crystal_bent window. 
               Please refer to the information under the HELP
		button for a complete description of the parameters. After 
		pressing the ACCEPT button, the corresponding code starts 
		running.
  Set Defaults: Sets the default parameters.
  Takagi-Taupin specific parameters: two items (Set Parameters &
		Set Defaults) allows to define the specific parameters
		for Takagi-Taupin calculations. They are placed in different
		windows to allow a too complicated main window.

  Show: Plot, View or Print the results.
    Diffraction Curves: display calculated diffraction curves.
    Bent Crystal Parameters: shows numerical parameters of the 
		calculations.
    Crystallographic Parameters: shows numerical parameters used
		for the calculation of the crystal structure factor.
    Takagi-Taupin: Some specific outputs only available if using
		the Takagi-Taupin theory.
        Integration Network: Shows the integration network with the
		electric field corresponding to y=0. 
		This option is only available when the calculations is 
		requested in the TAKAGI-TAUPIN/SET PARAMETERS option.
        All Reflectivity Curves: Shows an array of diffraction
		profiles corresponding, each one, to one knot in the 
		incident surface.
		This option is useful to check that the "window" parameter 
		is large enough to avoid border effects in the main (central) 
		diffraction profile.
		This option is only available when the calculations is 
		requested in the TAKAGI-TAUPIN/SET PARAMETERS option.
