 BM is an widget based graphical interface to calculate the spectum 
 of Bending Magnets as a function of the photon energy.

 DESCRIPTION OF THE CONTROLS IN THE MAIN WINDOW:

  File:
   BM input parameters: This option allows to save the current
		parameters to a file for later loading. It also allows
		to save the current parameters as defaults for being
		used when the application is initialized. In the last
		case, the file is named "application".xop (where 
		"application " is the name of the current XOP
		application) and is written in the directory pointed
		by the XOP_DEFAULTS_DIR environment variable (which
		must be set). The parameter file is ASCII and can be
		read and edited with care.
   Write Files for XOP/Optics: Saves the current undulator
		spectrum in the SRCOMPE (flux) and SRCOMPW (Power) files
		to be used for the other XOP application from Optics
		menu.
   Quit: to exit from the program

  Set_Parameters:
   Set Parameters: to define the parameters for the calculation.
		The same result is obtained pressing the "Set Parameters"
		button in the main BM window. 
                Please refer to the information under the HELP
		button for a complete description of the parameters. 
   Set Defaults: Sets the default parameters.

  Show: Display results. Several options are available
   Plot energy spectra
   Plot angular distribution (all wavelengths) 
   Plot angular distribution (one wavelength) 
   Plot (angular,energy) distribution 
   2D plot flux (anglular-energy) distribution
   2D plot power (anglular-energy) distribution
   View numerical values

  Help:   Shows the BM help (this text).
