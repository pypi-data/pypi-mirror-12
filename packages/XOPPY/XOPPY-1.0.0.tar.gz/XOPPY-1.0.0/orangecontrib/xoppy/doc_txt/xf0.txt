==================================   xF0   ====================================


 xf0 is a widget based graphical interface to calculate Elastic
 Photon-Atom Scattering versus x=sin(theta/2)/lambda.

 The data are taken from the DABAX data base. 
 It uses the following DABAX files:
   f0_*.dat  (for f0 values) 

   Compounds.dat   (for mixture and compounds list)

 CUSTOMIZATION OF XF0 DABAX PARAMETERS:
  -If you want to add(remove) another f0_* file, just add(remove) it
   in any(all) directory of $DABAX_PATH. 
 -If you want to modify the mixture table  list, do the following:
     a) copy the Compounds.dat DABAX file to a given directory 
        (e.g., current directory ".")
     b) Modify this file to add/remove/change the entries.
     c) Redefine $DABAX_PATH to include your new directoty:
        setenv  DABAX_PATH = .:$DABAX_PATH
     d) Restart the application.

 DESCRIPTION OF THE CONTROLS IN THE MAIN WINDOW:

  File:
    XF0 input parameters: This option allows to save the current
		parameters to a file for later loading. It also allows
		to save the current parameters as defaults for being
		used when the application is initialized. In the last
		case, the file is named "application".xop (where 
		"application " is the name of the current XOP
		application) and is written in the directory pointed
		by the XOP_DEFAULTS_DIR environment variable (which
		must be set). The parameter file is ASCII and can be
		read and edited with care.
  Quit: to exit from the program

 Set_Parameters:
  Set Parameters: to define the parameters for the calculation.
		The same result is obtained pressing the "Set Parameters"
		button in the main XF0 window. 
		After pressing the ACCEPT button, F0 starts running and
		displays a graphical window with the results.

  Help:   Shows the Xf0 help (this text).
