==============================  Xurgent   =====================================

 Xurgent is an widget based graphical interface to calculate
 spectra of an undulator insertion devices.
 
 It interfaces the program URGENT written by R.P.Walker and B.Diviacco
 (see Help/Urgent)

 DESCRIPTION OF THE CONTROLS IN THE MAIN WINDOW:

  File:
    Xurgent input parameters: This option allows to save the current
		parameters to a file for later loading. It also allows
		to save the current parameters as defaults for being
		used when the application is initialized. In the last
		case, the file is named "application".xop (where 
		"application " is the name of the current XOP
		application) and is written in the directory pointed
		by the XOP_DEFAULTS_DIR environment variable (which
		must be set). The parameter file is ASCII and can be
		read and edited with care.
    Urgent file: This option allows to load/write the current parameter
		and result files for further calculations. The used file
		formats are those used by URGENT. Therefore, they
		can be used to run URGENT without the interface or to
		import URGENT files created outside the XUrgent application.
    Write Files for XOP/Optics: Saves the current undulator
		spectrum in the SRCOMPE (flux) and SRCOMPW (Power) files
		to be used for the other XOP application from Optics
		menu.
  Quit: to exit from the program

 Set_Parameters:
  K(gap) Tool: This tool permits to calculate the deflection
		parameter K as a function of the magnet gap.
  Set Parameters: to define the parameters for the calculation.
		The same result is obtained pressing the "Set Parameters"
		button in the main XUrgent window. 
               Please refer to the information under the HELP
		button for a complete description of the parameters. After 
		pressing the ACCEPT button, URGENT starts running.
  Set Defaults: Sets the default parameters.

  Show: Display results
    Plot Results: Plots the URGENT results.
    Show Numerical Results: Displays the URGENT result file.

  Help:   Shows the URGENT help and the XURGENT help (this text).
