====================================  Xtc   ===================================

   Xtc is an widget based graphical user interface to calculate on-axis
   brilliance tuning curves for an ideal undulator insertion device using
   the Bessel function approximation (regular planar device or helical device).
   The calculation is performed by the program TC ("tuning curves") which is
   executed from the XTC interface. The effects of the particle beam
   emittance and beam energy spread are taken into account.


 DESCRIPTION OF THE CONTROLS IN THE MAIN WINDOW:

  File:
    Xtc input parameters: This option allows to save the current
		parameters to a file for later loading. It also allows
		to save the current parameters as defaults for being
		used when the application is initialized. In the last
		case, the file is named "application".xop (where 
		"application " is the name of the current XOP
		application) and is written in the directory pointed
		by the XOP_DEFAULTS_DIR environment variable (which
		must be set). The parameter file is ASCII and can be
		read and edited with care.
    TC file: This option allows to load/write the current parameter
		and result files for further calculations. The used file
		formats are those used by TC. Therefore, they
		can be used to run TC without the interface or to
		import TC files created outside the XTC application.
  Quit: to exit from the program

 Set_Parameters:
  Set Parameters: to define the parameters for the calculation.
		The same result is obtained pressing the "Set Parameters"
		button in the main XTC window. 
               Please refer to the information under the HELP
		button for a complete description of the parameters. After 
		pressing the ACCEPT button, TC starts running.
  Set Defaults: Sets the default parameters.

  Show: Display results
    Plot ...: Plots the different TC results.
    View Results: Displays the TC result file, tc.out, in a scrollable 
		window. The file may be printed from this window.

  Help:   Shows the TC help and the XTC help (this text).
