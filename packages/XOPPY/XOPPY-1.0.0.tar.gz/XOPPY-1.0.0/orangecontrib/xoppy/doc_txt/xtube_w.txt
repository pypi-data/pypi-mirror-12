================================   xtube_w   ===================================


 xtube_w is an widget based graphical interface to calculate the spectum 
 of a Tungsten X-ray tube.

 It uses a routine routine to generates spectra (photons/mm**2 per keV) for 
 one mAs and the output is calibrated to the output of a constant potential 
 generator in our laboratory (a Toshiba Model 2050 x-ray generator with a 
 "Rotanode" x-ray tube with housing model DRX-573HD-S and insert model 
 DR-5735H).
 These spectra were calibrated to output (mR/mAs) values and HVL values
 that were measured down the central axis of the x-ray beam.  The output
 data are given in the manuscript:
 "An accurate method for computer- generating tunsten anode x-ray spectra from 
 30 to 140 kV", JM Boone and JA Seibert, Medical Physics 24(11) pp.1661-1670,
 November 1997.

 DESCRIPTION OF THE CONTROLS IN THE MAIN WINDOW:

  File:
    Xtube_W input parameters: This option allows to save the current
		parameters to a file for later loading. It also allows
		to save the current parameters as defaults for being
		used when the application is initialized. In the last
		case, the file is named "application".xop (where 
		"application " is the name of the current XOP
		application) and is written in the directory pointed
		by the XOP_DEFAULTS_DIR environment variable (which
		must be set). The parameter file is ASCII and can be
		read and edited with care.
    Write Files for XOP/Optics: Saves the current undulator
		spectrum in the SRCOMPE (flux) and SRCOMPW (Power) files
		to be used for the other XOP application from Optics
		menu.
  Quit: to exit from the program

 Set_Parameters:
  Set Parameters: to define the parameters for the calculation.
		The same result is obtained pressing the "Set Parameters"
		button in the main Xtube_w window. 
               Please refer to the information under the HELP
		button for a complete description of the parameters. After 
		pressing the ACCEPT button, xtube_w starts running.
  Set Defaults: Sets the default parameters.

  Show: Display results
    Plot Results: Plots the xtube_w rsult: flux per sec per 1 keV bandwidth 
                and per mm^2 collected at 1 m from the target. 

  Help:   Shows the xtube_w help (this text).
