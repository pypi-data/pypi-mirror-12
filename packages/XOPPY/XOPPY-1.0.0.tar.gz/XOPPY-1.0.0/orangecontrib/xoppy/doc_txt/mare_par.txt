Description of the input parameters for MARE:
==============================================

Crystal:           crystal type

H main
K main
L main             (H,K,L) of the primary reflection [deg] 

H max:             max H for calculated reflection curves. 
K max:             max K
L max:             max L

Eliminate reflections with fh less than: 
                   Numerical value for discarding low intensity reflections. 
                   Default 1d-8, eliminates zero (i.e., forbidden) reflections.
                   Look at the outputs using "Edit buffer" button in the 
                   output windows to see the used fh (real part of the 
                   structure factor).

Display:           select thetype of output

Wavelength [A]:        The wavelength (in A) for calculating the 
                       unweg pattern (the line wavelength=constant
                       intersect the curves in the spaghetti plot).
Delta Wavelength [A]:  The band width around Wavelength.

Phi [deg] (for Glitches):   Phi value for the vertical cut of the
                            spaghetti plot. 

Delta Phi [deg]:       the band width around Phi.
