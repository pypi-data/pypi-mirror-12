 =================================  EXODUS ===============================

   EXODUS is a widget based application to manipulate SPEC files: 

	1) It loads a SPEC file and user can  select, view, interpolate, 
		average, and perform operations with data from multiple scans. 
	   It also accepts MCS SPEC scans. Hete the XCol=1 means channel
		numbet and XCol=2 means Energy (using calibration from
		spec file).
          It also loads data from ASCII files and from other XPlot windows.
	2) It allows to export the selected data set from one or 
		many SPEC files into files af different types
		(Spec/Scan,Spac/Mesh, etc.)
	3) It contains some tools to convert and operate with 
		lists of Spec/MCA files.

 ============= Non interactive use of EXODUS  ============================

	NAME:
		EXODUS
	PURPOSE:
		Manipulate and overplot multiple sets of data.
 	CATEGORY:
		Widgets. SPEC tools.
	CALLING SEQUENCE:
		EXODUS 
	KEYWORD PARAMETERS:
		GROUP = The widget ID of the widget that calls Xplot.
			When this ID is specified, a death of the caller 
			results in a death of EXODUS.
		NO_BLOCK = Set this keyword to start EXODUS and leaving
			unblocked the IDL prompt (default: no_block=1)
		XAFS = Set this keyword to start EXODUS with some
			functionality for EXAFS data treatment. 
		OnlyRight = Set this keyword if you want to eliminate
			the spec preparation panel.
		Quit_button = Set this keyword if you want to create
			a QUIT button in the right panel.
		Xlog = Set this keyword to start plots in log (X)
		Ylog = Set this keyword to start plots in log (Y)
               Wtitle = String with the window title

	OUTPUTS:
		Open the widget utility.
	COMMON BLOCKS:
		Exodus, to store some widget values
	HISTORY:
		EXODUS was  designed for being an application aiming
		to average multiple scans for the ESRF beamline ID26
		(at the time dedicated to EXafs Of DilUte Samples,
		origin of the program title). However, as the
		application revealed to be of general interest, it was 
		promoted to be a general XOP tool. The "particularities" 
		of EXAFS data analysis (i.e., interpolate and resample in 
		k space, etc.), are hidden in the standard version, and are 
		only available if EXODUS is started using the XAFS keyword on.
