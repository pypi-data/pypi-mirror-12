==================================   BLACK BODY  ===============================


 BLACK_BODY is an widget based graphical interface to calculate the spectum 
 of a black body emitter as a function of the photon energy.

 The formulas used can be obtained, for example, from:
 David Attwood
 Soft X-rays and extreme ultraviolet radiation. Principles and applications
 Cambridge University Press, 2000, Pags. 242-246

 DESCRIPTION OF THE CONTROLS IN THE MAIN WINDOW:

  File:
   Black_body input parameters: This option allows to save the current
		parameters to a file for later loading. It also allows
		to save the current parameters as defaults for being
		used when the application is initialized. In the last
		case, the file is named "application".xop (where 
		"application " is the name of the current XOP
		application) and is written in the directory pointed
		by the XOP_DEFAULTS_DIR environment variable (which
		must be set). The parameter file is ASCII and can be
		read and edited with care.
    Write Files for XOP/Optics: Saves the current undulator
		spectrum in the SRCOMPE (flux) and SRCOMPW (Power) files
		to be used for the other XOP application from Optics
		menu.
  Quit: to exit from the program

 Set_Parameters:
  Set Parameters: to define the parameters for the calculation.
		The same result is obtained pressing the "Set Parameters"
		button in the main BLACK_BODY window. 
                Please refer to the information under the HELP
		button for a complete description of the parameters. 
  Set Defaults: Sets the default parameters.

  Show: Display results. Several options are available
    Plot Results: Makes a plot pf the results
    View Results: Diaplays some numerical information

  Help:   Shows the BLACK_BODY help (this text).
