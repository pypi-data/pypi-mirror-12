==============================  Xpower   =====================================

 Xpower is a widget based graphical interface to calculate the transmission 
 in terms of flux or spectral power energy as a function pf photon
 energy for a set of up to five attenuators and mirrors. 

 It uses the DABAX files to get reflectivities and transmissions.

 DESCRIPTION OF THE CONTROLS IN THE MAIN WINDOW:

  File:
    Xpower input parameters: This option allows to save the current
		parameters to a file for later loading. It also allows
		to save the current parameters as defaults for being
		used when the application is initialized. In the last
		case, the file is named "application".xop (where 
		"application " is the name of the current XOP
		application) and is written in the directory pointed
		by the XOP_DEFAULTS_DIR environment variable (which
		must be set). The parameter file is ASCII and can be
		read and edited with care.
  Quit: to exit from the program

 Set_Parameters:
  Set Parameters: to define the parameters for the calculation.
		The same result is obtained pressing the "Set Parameters"
		button in the main XPower window. 
               Please refer to the information under the HELP
		button for a complete description of the parameters. After 
		pressing the ACCEPT button, XPower starts running.

		If you whish to calculate values for a single energy point 
		instead of an array of energy points [default], set the energy 
		minimum equal to the energy maximum. In this case, the 
		results will be presented in a common text window for all the 
		three options in the "Show" menu.
  Set Defaults: Sets the default parameters.

  Show: Produces a graphic of the results (Local properties, cumulated
	properties) and shows text parameters. In the case that a single
	energy point is calculated (by setting the minimum energy equal
	to the maximum energy), the three menu entries will display the
	same text parameters.
      
       Two values of delta/beta paremeter (in local properties) are given:
         i) delta/betaPCE where betaPCE is the "total" beta, i.e., calculated
            from the total cross section (photoelectric+compton+rayleigh)
         i) delta/betaPC where betaPC soes not consider coherent scattering,
            i.e., from photoelectric + compton scattering.

  Help:   Shows the xpower help (this text).
