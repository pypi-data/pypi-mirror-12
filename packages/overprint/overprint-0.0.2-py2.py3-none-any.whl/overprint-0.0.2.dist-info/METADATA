overprint
=========

Utility to help rewrite previous line of text,

Usefull and keep user informed of advancement, and keep a reactive
command line interface

.. code:: python

    import time
    from overprint import overprint


    with overprint() as (reprint, print):
        print('step 1')
        for i in range(10):
            reprint('.'* ( i % 3 +1))
            time.sleep(0.5)

    # will display 3 animated dots

The reprinted line will keep moving down while you use the normal
``print`` statement which does not change normal programming flow.

overprint even provide you with an option to replace (temporarily) the
built-in print statement in case you do not control the underlying
libraries.

use ``python -m overprint`` for a demo
