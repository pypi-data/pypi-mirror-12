GameOfLife is a python3 package that provides two classes
that together implement Conway's Game of Life.

Install the GameOfLife package using pip::

   $ sudo pip3 install GameOfLife


Or clone the git repository::

   $ git clone https://github.com/JnyJny/GameOfLife.git
   $ cd GameOfLife
   $ sudo python3 setup.py install

Also included in the package is CGameOfLife, a python script that
displays the simulation in a terminal window using curses.

Old skool is best skool.
