# aptly_api_cli

### Why do we need another aptly cli interface?
- Because aptly-api-cli has a lot of more features build in.
- aptly-api-cli is made accessible to the python community


# Description
This python command line interface, executes calls to the Aptly server remotely, without blocking the Aptly database.
All functionality from here http://www.aptly.info/doc/api/ is extended by even more useful features, like clean out last N
snapshots or packages, etc. pp

You can make either use of the aptly_api_request.py as a starting point for your own application or just use the cli (aptly_api_cli.py)
bundled with this repository to execute your requests via command line.

All uploaded files are stored under <rootDir>/upload directory (see configuration). This directory would be created automatically if it doesnâ€™t exist.

python aptly_api_cli.py --file_list_dirs

Upload file to local upload-directory 
```
python aptly_api_cli.py --file_upload=UPLOAD_DIR FILE

Add package from upload folder to local repo
```
python aptly_api_cli.py --repo_add_package_from_upload=REPO_NAME UPLOAD_DIR PACKAGE_NAME
```

#### List files
