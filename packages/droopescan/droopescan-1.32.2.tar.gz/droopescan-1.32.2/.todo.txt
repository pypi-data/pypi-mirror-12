Version 1.x:
    - When mass-scanning with CMS provided, it sometimes says cms_name is
          something it's not. Like, when versions: [] is empty true, but now even
          more misleading.
    - InvalidSchema: No connection adapters were found for 'd:/htdocs/404.html'
    - URL after redirect is not provided?
    - SIGINT capture for new scanning.
    - Interesting URLs for joomla.

    - Break API to detect plugin version.
