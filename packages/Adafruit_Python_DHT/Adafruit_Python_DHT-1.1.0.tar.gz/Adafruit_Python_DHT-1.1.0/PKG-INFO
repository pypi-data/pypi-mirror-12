Description: Adafruit Python DHT Sensor Library
        ==================================
        
        Python library to read the DHT series of humidity and temperature sensors on a Raspberry Pi or Beaglebone Black.
        
        Designed specifically to work with the Adafruit DHT series sensors ----> https://www.adafruit.com/products/385
        It is also know to work with AM2302 based sensors.
        
        This is a fork of https://github.com/adafruit/Adafruit_Python_DHT so that I could put a copy up on PyPi as this hasn't been done by the original author.
        
        Currently the library is only tested with Python 2.6/2.7.
        
        For all platforms (Raspberry Pi and Beaglebone Black) make sure your system is able to compile Python extensions.  On Raspbian or Beaglebone Black's Debian/Ubuntu image you can ensure your system is ready by executing:
        
        ````
        sudo apt-get update
        sudo apt-get install build-essential python-dev
        ````
        
        Install the library by downloading with the download link on the right, unzipping the archive, and executing:
        
        ````
        sudo python setup.py install
        ````
        
        See example of usage in the examples folder.
