Description: ftputil is a high-level FTP client library for the Python programming
        language. ftputil implements a virtual file system for accessing FTP servers,
        that is, it can generate file-like objects for remote files. The library
        supports many functions similar to those in the os, os.path and
        shutil modules. ftputil has convenience functions for conditional uploads
        and downloads, and handles FTP clients and servers in different timezones.
Platform: Pure Python (Python version >= 2.0)
