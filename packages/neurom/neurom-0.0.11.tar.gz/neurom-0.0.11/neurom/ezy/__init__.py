''' Quick and easy neuron morphology analysis tools

Examples:

    Load a neuron

    >>> from neurom import ezy
    >>> nrn = ezy.load_neuron('some/data/path/morph_file.swc')

    Obtain some morphometrics

    >>> apical_seg_lengths = nrn.get_segment_lengths(ezy.TreeType.apical_dendrite)
    >>> axon_sec_lengths = nrn.get_section_lengths(ezy.TreeType.axon)

    View it in 2D and 3D

    >>> fig2d, ax2d = ezy.view(nrn)
    >>> fig2d.show()
    >>> fig3d, ax3d = ezy.view3d(nrn)
    >>> fig3d.show()

    Load neurons from a directory. This loads all SWC or HDF5 files it finds\
    and returns a list of neurons

    >>> import numpy as np  # For mean value calculation
    >>> nrns = ezy.load_neurons('some/data/directory')
    >>> for nrn in nrns:
    ...     print 'mean section length', np.mean([n for n in nrn.get_section_lengths()])
