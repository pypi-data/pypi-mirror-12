Home Assistant is a home automation platform running on Python 3. The goal of Home Assistant is to be able to track and control all devices at home and offer a platform for automating control.

To get started:
```bash
python3 -m pip install homeassistant
hass --open-ui
```

Check out [the website](https://home-assistant.io) for [a demo][demo], installation instructions, tutorials and documentation.

Built home automation on top of your devices:

 * Keep a precise history of every change to the state of your house
 * Turn on the lights when people get home after sun set
 * Turn on lights slowly during sun set to compensate for less light
 * Turn off all lights and devices when everybody leaves the house
 * Offers a [REST API](https://home-assistant.io/developers/api.html) and can interface with MQTT for easy integration with other projects like [OwnTracks](http://owntracks.org/)
 * Allow sending notifications using [Instapush](https://instapush.im), [Notify My Android (NMA)](http://www.notifymyandroid.com/), [PushBullet](https://www.pushbullet.com/), [PushOver](https://pushover.net/), [Slack](https://slack.com/), [Telegram](https://telegram.org/), and [Jabber (XMPP)](http://xmpp.org)

The system is built modular so support for other devices or actions can be implemented easily. See also the [section on architecture](https://home-assistant.io/developers/architecture.html) and the [section on creating your own components](https://home-assistant.io/developers/creating_components.html).
