The build-friendly PyPI fake.

Introduction
------------
reqpi is a server that can pretend to be a PyPI clone,
but is optimized to be friendy to be a build system.
It creates ad-hoc end-points which serve an extremely
limited subset of PyPI.

Usage
-----

.. code::

   $ twistd reqpi --http $PORT
   $ url=`python -m reqpi gethash --url http://localhost:2000/ requirements.txt`
   $ pip install --index-url $url requirements.txt

This will make sure that if :code:`requirements.txt` is incomplete,
the build will fail, rather than getting the latest version of the dependency
that is missing.

The URL should also work with other things that access PyPI, like PEX
or Pants. For appropriate ways to get those systems to access the ad-hoc
URL, refer to the package documentation.
