    class MyModel(models.Model):

Field Options
*************

Django fancy cronfield extend CharField, so all options available at
CharField can be used with CronField as well. Here is a list of
kwargs which CronField has added or altered:

 - `max_length`: is set to 120 by default, however you can override it at will.
 - `daily_limit`: Specifies maximum value which cron frequency per day can be.
   None means no limit.
