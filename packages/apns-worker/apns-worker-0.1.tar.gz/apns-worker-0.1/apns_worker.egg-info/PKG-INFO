Description: apns-worker
        ===========
        
        This is a client library for Apple's push notification service. It is not the
        first such library for Python, but, as is often the way, the existing options
        didn't quite meet our needs:
        
        #. **No dependencies** (other than six).
        #. **Fire and forget**. APNs is a quirky binary protocol that frequently requires
           reconnecting to the service and re-sending notifications after an error.
        #. **Robust**. We don't do quick and dirty here. Readability, tests, and
           documentation are not optional.
        
        
        Quick start
        -----------
        
        An APNs client is by nature stateful. The default apns-worker backend uses
        Python threads to asynchronously process a queue of messages to send to the
        service. Most users will want to maintain a global ApnsManager instance to
        process messages. Note that if your own program is threaded, you may need to
        take care to create this global instance safely.
        
        ::
        
            from apns_worker import ApnsManager
        
            apns = None
        
            def init_apns(key_path, cert_path):
                """ Call this once at program init time. """
                global apns
                apns = ApnsManager(key_path, cert_path)
        
            def send_badge(token, badge=1):
                """ Badge the app on a single device. """
                apns.send_aps([token], badge=badge)
