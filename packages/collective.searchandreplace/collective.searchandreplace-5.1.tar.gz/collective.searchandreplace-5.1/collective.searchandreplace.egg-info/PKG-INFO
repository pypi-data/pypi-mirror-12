        The collective.searchandreplace product is a Plone Add-on designed to find and replace text in Plone content objects, namely titles, descriptions, and document text. It operates over single or multiple Plone content objects and can preview as well as actuate changes.
        
        Optional features include being able to control searching in subfolders, and matching based on case sensatvity/insensativity.

        ----------------
        
        - Check if the user has the ``Modify portal content`` permission for

          [maurits]
        
        - Add separate permission for showing the action.  This makes it
          easier to restrict usage of Search and Replace if wanted.  By
          default the same roles have this permission as for the standard
          'Modify portal content' permission.  Added upgrade steps for this.
          Permission title is: 'collective.searchandreplace: Use Search And
          Replace'.
