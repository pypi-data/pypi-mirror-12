Package Description
-------------------
scikit-cuda provides Python interfaces to many of the functions in the CUDA
device/runtime, CUBLAS, CUFFT, and CUSOLVER libraries distributed as part of
NVIDIA's `CUDA Programming Toolkit <http://www.nvidia.com/cuda/>`_, as well as
interfaces to select functions in the free and standard versions of the `CULA
Dense Toolkit <http://www.culatools.com/dense>`_.  Both low-level wrapper
functions similar to their C counterparts and high-level functions comparable to
those in `NumPy and Scipy <http://www.scipy.org>`_ are provided.
