Description: # python-appstream
        
        If you want to parse AppStream files in Python you probably should
        just install libappstream-glib, and use the GObjectIntrospection bindings
        for that. AppStreamGlib is a much better library than this and handles
        many more kinds of component.
        
        If AppStreamGlib is not available to you (e.g. you're trying to run in an
        OpenShift instance on RHEL 6.2), this project might be somewhat useful.
        
        Contributors welcome, either adding new functionality or fixing bugs.
