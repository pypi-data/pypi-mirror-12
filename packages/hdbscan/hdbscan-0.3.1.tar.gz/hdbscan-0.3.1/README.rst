HDBSCAN
=======

HDBSCAN - Hierarchical Density-Based Spatial Clustering of Applications
with Noise. Performs DBSCAN over varying epsilon values and integrates 
the result to find a clustering that gives the best stability over epsilon.
This allows HDBSCAN to find clusters of varying densities (unlike DBSCAN),
and be more robust to parameter selection.

------------------
How to use HDBSCAN
------------------

The hdbscan package inherits from sklearn classes, and thus drops in neatly
next to other sklearn clusterers with an identical calling API. Similarly it
supports input in a variety of formats: an array (or pandas dataframe, or
sparse matrix) of shape `(num_samples x num_features)`; an array (or sparse matrix)
giving a distance matrix between samples.

.. code:: python

    import hdbscan
    
    clusterer = hdbscan.HDBSCAN(min_cluster_size=10)
    cluster_labels = clusterer.fit_predict(data)

-----------
Performance
-----------

Significant effort has been put into making the hdbscan implementation as fast as 
possible. It is more than twice as fast as the reference implementation in Java
and is competitive with highly optimized single linkage implementations in C and C++.
`current performance can be seen in this notebook <http://nbviewer.jupyter.org/github/lmcinnes/hdbscan/blob/master/notebooks/Benchmarking%20scalability%20of%20clustering%20implementations.ipynb>`_ 
and further performance improvements should be forthcoming in the next few releases.

------------------------
Additional functionality
------------------------

The hdbscan package comes equipped with visualization tools to help you
understand your clustering results. After fitting data the clusterer
object has attributes for:

* The condensed cluster hierarchy
* The robust single linkage cluster hierarchy
* The reachability distance minimal spanning tree

All of which come equipped with methods for plotting and converting
to Pandas or NetworkX for further analysis. See the notebook on
`how HDBSCAN works <http://nbviewer.jupyter.org/github/lmcinnes/hdbscan/blob/master/notebooks/How%20HDBSCAN%20Works.ipynb>`_ for examples and further details.

The clusterer objects also have an attribute providing cluster membership
strengths, resulting in optional soft clustering (and no further compute 
expense)

---------------------
Robust single linkage
---------------------

The hdbscan package also provides support for the *robust single linkage*
clustering algorithm of Chaudhuri and Dasgupta. As with the HDBSCAN 
implementation this is a high performance version of the algorithm 
outperforming scipy's standard single linkage implementation. The
robust single linkage hierarchy is available as an attribute of
the robust single linkage clusterer, again with the ability to plot
or export the hierarchy, and to extract flat clusterings at a given
cut level and gamma value.

Example usage:

.. code:: python

    import hdbscan
    
    clusterer = hdbscan.RobustSingleLinkage(cut=0.125, k=7)
    cluster_labels = clusterer.fit_predict(data)
    hierarchy = clusterer.cluster_hierarchy_
    alt_labels = hierarchy.get_clusters(0.100, 5)
    hierarchy.plot()
