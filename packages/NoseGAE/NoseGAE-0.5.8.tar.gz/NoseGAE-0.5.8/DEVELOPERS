This library requires the Google App Engine SDK in order to execute tests.
You can download it from Google yourself or you can run the gcloud installer
to do it for you.

EASY MODE

    > virtualenv myenv
    > source myenv/bin/activate
    > ./examples/install-gcloud-sdk.sh
    > pip install -r examples/test_requirements.txt
    > python setup.py develop

Now you can run any of the tests under the `examples` directory to make sure
you didn't break the world.
