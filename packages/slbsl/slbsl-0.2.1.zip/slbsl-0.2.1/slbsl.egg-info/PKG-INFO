Description: slbsl
        =====
        
        Convert paths from Windows to UNIX and vice versa.
        
        Written to slightly ease the pain of working in environments that use both like a bash on Windows. Do not pass arbitrary text to the tool, only a path (though it may be wrapped in quotation marks).
        
        
        Installation
        ------------
        
            pip install slbsl
        
        
        Dependencies
        ------------
        
        `pyperclip <http://pypi.python.org/pypi/pyperclip>`_ for clipboard functionality.
        
        
        Tests
        -----
        
        You need `pytest <http://pypi.python.org/pypi/pytest>`_ installed.
        
            py.test test_slbsl -v
        
        
        Usage
        -----
        
        The package installs two shell script that you can call::
        
             sl [path] : Converts <path> or clipboard content to UNIX convention.
            bsl [path] : Converts <path> or clipboard content to Windows convention.
        
        The result is returned to the commandline and stored additionally in the clipboard.
        
        
        Why the stupid name?
