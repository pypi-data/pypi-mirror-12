About HotQueue
==============

HotQueue is a Python library that allows you to use `Redis <http://code.google.com/p/redis/>`_ as a message queue within
your Python programs.

This fork of HotQueue uses redislite to allow running without installing and running a separate Redis server.

To install it, run::

    pip install -U redislite-hotqueue

The best place to get started is `the documentation <http://richardhenry.github.com/hotqueue/>`_.
