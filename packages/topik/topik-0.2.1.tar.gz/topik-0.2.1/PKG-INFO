        Topik
        =====
        
        A Topic Modeling toolbox.
        
        Introduction
        ------------
        
        The aim of ``topik`` is to provide a full suite and high-level interface
        for anyone interested in applying topic modeling. For that purpose,
        ``topik`` includes many utilities beyond statistical modeling algorithms
        and wraps all of its features into an easy callable function and a
        command line interface.
        
        ``Topik`` is built on top of existing natural language and topic
        modeling libraries and primarily provides a wrapper around them, for a
        quick and easy exploratory analysis of your text data sets.
