Description: # Flask Babeled
        
        Implements i18n and l10n support for Flask.  This is based on the Python
        babel module as well as pytz both of which are installed automatically
        for you if you install this library.
        
        This is a fork of [Flask-Babel](https://github.com/python-babel/flask-babel). I
        have a need of this for work I am currently doing, and wish to modify it as
        support for the original project seems to have disappeared. Will attempt to
        maintain identical functionality but provide a separate package.
