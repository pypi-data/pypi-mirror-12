   # Markdown extension is a converter that parses markdown sources and

         - codehilite      # adds code/syntax highlighting
         - extra           # enables tables, footnotes, etc

   # reStructuredText is a converter that parses reStructuredText sources
   # and generated html pages extracting some meta information. Currently
   # it supports low-level docutils settings which are passed to docutils
   # "As Is". They aren't useful for users, but mentioned for nerds. It's
   # ok if you remove it from your own _config.yml.
   restructuredtext:
      docutils:
         initial_header_level: 2      # start sections from <h2>

   # Tags generator will extract tags from your posts and create "tag pages".
   # Tag page contains list of posts which contain certain tag.
   tags:
      template:      document-list.html   # template name for rendering tags page
      output:        tags/                # output directory for tags pages

      port:    5000        # port number of the host
      wakeup:  1           # time in seconds used to set how often
                           # content changes will be tracked
