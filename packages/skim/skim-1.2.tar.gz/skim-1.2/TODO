Docs
====
- man page support (or just doc it)
- more commenting

Config, Settings, Persistence
=============================
- rc file that remembers the old searches for each file, plus the recent
searches on any file
 (so you can do the same search on a few files in a row), plus it keeps
 its rc file size from getting too big by tossing the very old searches
- list wordnet path, whether to use wordnet
- default settings
- remember window size/position, possibly per-file
- bindings

Searching
=========
- regexps too, allow escaping whitespace to include it in search, optional
  automatic \bwholeword\b matching

Colors
======
- a little syntax highlighting
- hues should be spread around the spectrum for any number of terms
    [partially done]
- if one search term is a syn of another, notice that and do the right
  thing with coloring (like make the syns the same color)
- do syns with saturation, let the user disable syns or pick synsets
  as needed
- you should put most important words first, and have those show in
  different hues

Files
=====
- very short files reveal math errors
- handle giant files like less does (lazy reading)
- tail-style file watching
- multiple files at a time (super grep)

Birdseye
========
- leave "footprints" on the birdseye. if i sit at a position for many
  seconds, leave a green mark there so i can remember where i was
- similar to the last note, one should be able to manually add a bookmark
  Maybe: name bookmarks and let people navigate by list-o-bookmarks
- optional multiple columns in the canvas, optional threshold at which
  that feature turns on
- canvases with more than one line of text per pixel row need to draw nicely
- find dates in the file, and annotate the birdseye view with them

Window
======
- auto-width the new window to the max line length (up to some limit)
- wrapping controls inside skim
- errors/msgs (of which there should be few) appear in a growing, scrollable 
  text box at the bottom

Misc. Features
==============
- wordnet support
- console mode. dynamically switch from console<->gui modes. console mode
  will simulate the highlighting with ansi colors
