Description: A Python wrapper for the SQLite embedded relational database engine.
        
        WARNING: This is a bayeslite custom edition.  This is not the normal
        apsw.  It is a temporary kludge until the `apsw' package on pypi
        works.  This was customized by running::
        
            python setup.py fetch --sqlite --version=3.9.2
        
        so that it includes a copy of a working version of sqlite3 instead of
        relying on whatever version your system may have installed.
        
        In contrast to other wrappers such as pysqlite it focuses on being
        a minimal layer over SQLite attempting just to translate the
        complete SQLite API into Python.
