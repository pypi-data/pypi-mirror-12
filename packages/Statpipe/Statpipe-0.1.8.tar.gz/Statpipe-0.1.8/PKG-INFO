Description: Statpipe
        ========
        
        Statpipe is a simple command line utility allowing Stata commands to be
        piped into Stata, and the output returned. 2 For example:
        
        ::
        
            echo "di 2+2" | statpipe
            . di 2^2
            4
        
        You can also use in interactive mode (although state isn't saved across
        calculations):
        
        ::
        
            statpipe
            > Enter a stata expression (e.g. di 2*2):
            di 2*2
            > Cached output re-used
            > . di 2*2
            > 4
        
        Or from a Python script you can import and use like so:
        
        ::
        
            from statpipe import run_stata_code
            print run_stata_code("di 2+2").split("\n")
            > ['. di 2+2', '4', '']
        
        To install, download and:
        
        ::
        
            cd statpipe
            python setup.py install #you might need to sudo if installing in system python
        
        or
        
        ::
        
            pip install statpipe
        
        Dependencies
        ------------
        
        Obviously depends on Stata.
        
        Tested with version 12 through 14 on OS X. Should work for Linux/Unix
        too.
