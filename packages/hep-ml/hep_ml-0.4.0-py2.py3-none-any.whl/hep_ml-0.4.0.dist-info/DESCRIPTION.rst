hep\_ml
=======

**hep\_ml** provides specific machine learning tools for purposes of
high energy physics (written in python).

Main points
-----------

-  uniform classifiers - the classifiers with low correlation of
   predictions and mass (or some other variable(s))
-  **uBoost** optimized implementation inside
-  **UGradientBoosting** (with different losses, specially
   **FlatnessLoss** is very interesting)
-  measures of uniformity (see **hep\_ml.metrics**)
-  advanced losses for classification, regression and ranking for
   **UGradientBoosting** (see **hep\_ml.losses**).
-  **hep\_ml.nnet** - theano-based flexible neural networks
-  **hep\_ml.reweight** - reweighting multidimensional distributions
   (*multi* here means 2, 3, 5 and more dimensions - see GBReweighter!)
-  **sklearn**-compatibility of estimators.

Installation
------------

.. code:: bash

    pip install hep_ml
