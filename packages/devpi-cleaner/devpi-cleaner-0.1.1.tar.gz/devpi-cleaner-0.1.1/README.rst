Léon, the devpi cleaner, helps to batch removal of files from a `devpi server`_. Given a package and version specification
it will remove the specified versions of a package from all indices of a given user.

Rationale
=========
Devpi cleaner wraps the original `devpi remove` command. It provides the following extensions:

* Conditionally limit removal to development packages.
* Temporarily switch non-volatile indices to volatile.
* Apply a remove operation to all indices of a user.

Léon by Example
===============

The following command will delete all development packages preceding version 0.2 of ``delete_me`` in indices of
the user::

    > devpi-cleaner http://localhost:2414/ user 'delete_me<=0.2' --dev-only
    Password:
    Packages to be deleted:
     * http://localhost:2414/user/index2/+f/842/84d1283874110/delete_me-0.2.dev2.tar.gz
     * http://localhost:2414/user/index2/+f/636/95eef6ac86c76/delete_me-0.2.dev2-py2.py3-none-any.whl
     * http://localhost:2414/user/index1/+f/842/84d1283874110/delete_me-0.2.dev2.tar.gz
     * http://localhost:2414/user/index1/+f/636/95eef6ac86c76/delete_me-0.2.dev2-py2.py3-none-any.whl
    Enter "yes" to confirm: yes
    >

As shown, packages will be listed and confirmation required before they are actually deleted from the server.
