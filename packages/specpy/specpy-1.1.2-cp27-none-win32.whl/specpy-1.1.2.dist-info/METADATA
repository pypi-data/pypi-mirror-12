==========================
Imspector Python Interface
==========================

Imspector comes with a Python Interface named SpecPy which can be used either 
from the embedded Python console or from an external Python console running on 
the same computer (to enable sharing of measurement data) or even running on a 
different computer. 

--------------------
Setup
--------------------

To setup SpecPy you first need to install

- Python 2.7.9, 3.4.2, or 3.5.0 together with
- NumPy-MKL 1.8.2

Then from the Command Prompt run

.. code-block:: bat

  python.exe -m pip install --upgrade specpy

--------------------
Start
--------------------

- Working from an external Python console you need to start the Imspector 
  Server (with requires Administrator permissions the first time):

.. figure:: images/ImspectorRunServer.png

- To load the Python Interface just say

.. code-block:: python

  from specpy import *
