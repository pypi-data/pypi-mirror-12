        A unified Python package for calculating buffer properties.
        
        **ionize** calculates the properties of individual ionic species in
        aqueous solution, as well as aqueous solutions containing arbitrary sets
        of ions.
        
        The **ionize** model uses techniques demonstrated by
        `Peakmaster <http://web.natur.cuni.cz/gas/>`__,
        `Spresso <http://stanfordspresso.blogspot.com/>`__, and
        `STEEP <http://microfluidics.stanford.edu/download/>`__. The **ionize**
        model takes into account pH, ionic strength, and temperature effects,
        including the most up-to-date temperature model published in STEEP. The
        **ionize** object classes make these techniques directly accessible as a
        backend for simulations written in python.

        ionize Components
        -----------------
        
        **ionize** has two main components:
        
        The Ion Class
        ~~~~~~~~~~~~~
        
        The core of **ionize** is the **Ion** class, which represents a single
        ionic species. An ion contains a name, a set of ionization states, and
        an optional temperature parameter. Each ionization state contains a
        charge, a pKa, and an absolute mobility. An ionization state may also
        include values for ΔH and ΔCp of ionization to improve the accuracy of
        temperature correction.
        
        The Solution Class
        ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
        
        The **Solution** class represents an aqueous solution containing any
        number of ionic species. A **Solution** contains a list of **Ion**
        objects, and a second list containing the concentrations of each
        species. **Solution** can also take an optional temperature parameter.
        **Solution** solves for pH, iteratively accounting for the ionic
        strength. Based on ionic strength and pH, the **Ions** calculate their
        own properties, and the **Solution** calculates bulk properties like
        conductivity.
