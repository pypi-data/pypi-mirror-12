        Accumulator is a framework for the accumulation of occurrences with subjects.
        
        It consists of:
        
        - | Subjects
          | Representing any subject.
        - | Occurrences
          | Any event that happened to a Subject in a given time.
        - | Accumulators
          | An accumulator of occurrences with subjects. Occurrences can change the state
          | of the accumulator, and the accumulator logs the state changes. An Accumulator
          | only accumulates occurrences with one subject. It can accumulate any number
          | of occurrences, of any kind, given that they are occurrences of the same subject.
        - | Portfolios
          | A collection of accumulators. Portfolios also accumulates Occurrences with subjects,
          | but may accumulate occurrences with multiple subjects. Occurrences accumulated
          | by an Portfolio have the possibility of updating the state of any Accumulator
          | on the Portfolio, not just the accumulator related to the occurrence subject.
