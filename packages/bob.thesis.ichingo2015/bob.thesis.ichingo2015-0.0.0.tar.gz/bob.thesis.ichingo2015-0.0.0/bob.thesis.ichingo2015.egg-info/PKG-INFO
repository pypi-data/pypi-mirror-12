Description: ==============================================================================
         Code supporting the PhD thesis of Ivana Chingovska - Idiap Research Institute
        ==============================================================================
        
        This package contains scripts to be used to reproduce the results of my PhD thesis titled: "Trustworthy Biometric Recognition Under Spoofing Attacks: Application to the Face Mode". It was done during my work at the `Biometrics group <http://www.idiap.ch/~marcel/professional/Research_Team.html>`_ in `Idiap Research Institute <https://www.idiap.ch>`_ and `Ecole Polytechnique Fédérale de Lausanne (EPFL) <www.epfl.ch>`_ .
        
        Raw data
        --------
        
        The data used in the paper is publicly available and should be downloaded and
        installed **prior** to try using the programs described in this package. Visit
        `the REPLAY-ATTACK database portal
        <https://www.idiap.ch/dataset/replayattack>`_ for more information.
        
        Installation
        ------------
        
        The ``bob.thesis.ichingo2015`` package is a satellite package of the free signal processing and machine learning library Bob_. This dependency has to be downloaded manually. This version of the package depends on Bob_ version 2 or greater. To install `packages of Bob <https://github.com/idiap/bob/wiki/Packages>`_, please read the `Installation Instructions <https://github.com/idiap/bob/wiki/Installation>`_. For Bob_ to be able to work properly, some dependent Bob packages are required to be installed. Please make sure that you have read the Dependencies for your operating system.
        
        The most simple solution is to download and extract ``bob.thesis.ichingo2015`` package, and then run the following::
        
          $ cd bob.thesis.ichingo2015
          $ python bootstrap-buildout.py
          $ bin/buildout
        
        This will download all required dependent Bob_ and other packages and install them locally. 
        
        
        Using the package
        -----------------
        
        After instalation of the package, you can generate a documentation locally::
        
          $ ./bin/sphinx-build doc sphinx
        
        Now, the full documentation of the package, including a User Guide, will be availabe in ``sphinx/index.html``. It contains all the necessary information about how to run the scripts and reproduce the results.
