This User Guide consists of three parts:

1. **Part 1**: we are going to show how to generate anti-spoofing features and face verification features, which are used later by the other methods.

2. **Part 2**: we are going to show how to generate client-indepdendent and client-specific face anti-spoofing scores.

3. **Part 3**: we are going to show how to generate fusion scores for face verification and anti-spoofing systems.

4. **Part 4**: we are going to show the use of EPS framework for evaluation of biometric verification systms under spoofing attacks
