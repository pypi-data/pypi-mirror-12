    This is basically just a module that ensures your bot doesn't time out and

    it is highly recommended.

    This extension adds ``base.basic_rfc`` as itself as an alias for
    ``get_extension("BasicRFC").``.

        will be stored here. Useful in case of services collisions that change
        our nick, SANICK/FORCENICK operator abuse, or another extension
        changes our nick.
