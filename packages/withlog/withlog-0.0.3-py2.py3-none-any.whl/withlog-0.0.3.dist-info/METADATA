Withlog
=======

Logging as a context manager.

Visually inspired by how `Credo <https://github.com/rrrene/credo>`__
looks like, I always find difficult to communicate with user in command
line interface. So this is a logging/printing system which is more block
based than line base, and with color also.

The following will show a nice formatted message :

.. code:: python

    with Message('Hello there') as log:
        log('This is a Logging message context manager')
        log('it support nesting and will render in a User friendly way')
        log('I need to fix multi \nline \nstring')

.. figure:: ./screenshot/single_message.png
   :alt: 

You can nest these:

.. code:: python

    with Message('Hello there') as log:
        log('This is a Logging message context manager')
        log('it support nesting and will render in a User friendly way')
        log('I need to fix multi \nline \nstring')
        with Warning('Nested it does support') as log1:
            log1('like Yoda speach order ')
            log1('of words are')

        with Critical('Come to the dark side') as log2:
            log2('we have cookies')

            with OK("Paternity test") as log3:
                log3('I am your father')

To get nested messages:
