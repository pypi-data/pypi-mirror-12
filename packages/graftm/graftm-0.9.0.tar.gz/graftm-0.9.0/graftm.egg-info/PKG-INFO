        ## Overview
        Basically, GraftM is a pipeline used for identifying and classifying marker gene reads from metagenomic datasets. If you are after a tool that provide rapid and accurate analysis of short read sequence data, then you'll probably want to give GraftM a try
        
        Head on over to the [GraftM page](http://geronimp.github.io/graftM/) for more general information.
        
        Because GraftM is still being actively developed backwards incompatibility may happen in the future, although we will aim to minimise this as much as possible.
