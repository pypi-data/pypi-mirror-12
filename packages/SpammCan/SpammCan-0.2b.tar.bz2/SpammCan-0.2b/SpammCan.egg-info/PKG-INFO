Description: General Information
        -------------------
        
        SpammCan is yet another pastbin web application. It distinguishes itself from
        its competitors by the following features:
        
        * Has syntax highlighting support for over 100 languages thanks to the use of
        Pygments_.
        
        * Is easy to install thanks to setuptools_.
        
        * Uses large, random GUIDs for paste entries in its URLs instead of sequential
        paste numbers to discourage spammers.
        
        Also detects and rejects spamming attempts with the help of a SpamBayes_
        filter.
        
        * Is built on TurboGears_ 1.1, Genshi_, and SQLAlchemy_.
        
        * Uses a SQLite database by default, but can use any database system supported
        by SQLAlchemy and TurboGears.
