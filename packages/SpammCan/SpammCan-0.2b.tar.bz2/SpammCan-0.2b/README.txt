General Information
-------------------

SpammCan is yet another pastbin web application. It distinguishes itself from
its competitors by the following features:

* Has syntax highlighting support for over 100 languages thanks to the use of
  Pygments_.

* Is easy to install thanks to setuptools_.

* Uses large, random GUIDs for paste entries in its URLs instead of sequential
  paste numbers to discourage spammers.

  Also detects and rejects spamming attempts with the help of a SpamBayes_
  filter.

* Is built on TurboGears_ 1.1, Genshi_, and SQLAlchemy_.

* Uses a SQLite database by default, but can use any database system supported
  by SQLAlchemy and TurboGears.
