Lvlup- An audio playing module used directly in the mac command line
======

Whenever you accomplish a difficult task, finally demolish a bug,
or feel you have "leveled up", use lvlup to celebrate with you
favorite tone or short song.

This is a beginner project using afplay to play audio files directly
from the mac command line. 

I encourage people to help me improve this project as I am sure it
needs a lot of work.

Install
---

>>> pip install lvlup

Usage
---

>>> afplay(~/path/to/<filename>)

* Place any audio files in the static folder.
  Use the path or name (in dictionary format) to access file.
