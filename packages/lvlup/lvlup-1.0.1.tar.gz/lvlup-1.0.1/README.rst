Lvlup- An audio playing package used directly in the mac command line
======

Whenever you accomplish a difficult task, finally demolish a bug,
or feel you have "leveled up", use lvlup to celebrate with your
favorite tone or short song.

This is a beginner project using afplay to play audio files directly
from the mac command line.

I encourage people to help me improve this project as I am sure it
needs a lot of work. Feel free to fork this project.
