        ====
        
        runp exports Python functions from files to the command line. 
        You don't need to change your existing code.
        
        If you have a file named myfile.py with::
        
            def foo():
                """beeps a lot"""
                print "beep beep"
        
            def bar(text):
                """Prints things
        
                Args:
                    text (str): The text to print
                """
                print text
        
        And you want to run it in the command line just do::
        
            $ runp myfile.py foo
            beep beep
        
        You can also pass arguments to your functions::
        
            $ runp myfile.py bar:"this is sweet!"
            this is sweet!
        
        Functions with names starting with _ are hidden. 
        
        You can list available functions with::
        
            $ runp myfile.py -l
            Available functions:
            foo    beeps a lot
            bar    Prints things
        
        And get info on a specific function::
        
            $ runp myfile.py -d bar
            Displaying docstring for function bar in module myfile
        
            bar(text)
                Prints things
            
                Args:
                    text (str): The text to print
        
        Syntax for calling functions is::
            
            $ runp myfile.py function_name:arg1value,arg2=arg2value
        
        
        The concept, syntax for commands and initial code are heavily inspired by fabric's task system.
