Command-Line Usage
==================

The command-line syntax to run the ``nbconvert`` script is::

  $ jupyter nbconvert --to FORMAT notebook.ipynb

This will convert the Jupyter document file ``notebook.ipynb`` into the output
format given by the ``FORMAT`` string.

The default output format is html, for which the ``--to`` argument may be
omitted::

  $ jupyter nbconvert notebook.ipynb

Jupyter provides a few templates for some output formats, and these can be
specified via an additional ``--template`` argument.

The currently supported export formats are:

* ``--to html``

  - ``--template full`` (default)

    A full static HTML render of the notebook.
    This looks very similar to the interactive view.

  - ``--template basic``

    Simplified HTML, useful for embedding in webpages, blogs, etc.
    This excludes HTML headers.

* ``--to latex``

  Latex export.  This generates ``NOTEBOOK_NAME.tex`` file,
  ready for export.

  - ``--template article`` (default)

    Latex article, derived from Sphinx's howto template.

  - ``--template report``

    Latex report, providing a table of contents and chapters.

  - ``--template basic``

    Very basic latex output - mainly meant as a starting point for custom templates.

* ``--to pdf``

  Generates a PDF via latex. Supports the same templates as ``--to latex``.

* ``--to slides``

  This generates a Reveal.js HTML slideshow.
  It must be served by an HTTP server. The easiest way to do this is adding
  ``--post serve`` on the command-line. The ``serve`` post-processor proxies
  Reveal.js requests to a CDN if no local Reveal.js library is present.
  To make slides that don't require an internet connection, just place the
  Reveal.js library in the same directory where your_talk.slides.html is located,
  or point to another directory using the ``--reveal-prefix`` alias.

* ``--to markdown``

  Simple markdown output.  Markdown cells are unaffected,
  and code cells indented 4 spaces.

* ``--to rst``

  Basic reStructuredText output. Useful as a starting point for embedding notebooks
  in Sphinx docs.

* ``--to script``

  Convert a notebook to an executable script.
  This is the simplest way to get a Python (or other language, depending on the kernel) script out of a notebook.
  If there were any magics in an Jupyter notebook, this may only be executable from
  an Jupyter session.

* ``--to notebook``

  .. versionadded:: 3.0

  This doesn't convert a notebook to a different format *per se*,
  instead it allows the running of nbconvert preprocessors on a notebook,
  and/or conversion to other notebook formats. For example::

      jupyter nbconvert --to notebook --execute mynotebook.ipynb

  will open the notebook, execute it, capture new output, and save the result in
  :file:`mynotebook.nbconvert.ipynb`. By default, ``nbconvert`` will abort conversion
  if any exceptions occur during execution of a cell. If you specify ``--allow-errors``
  (in addition to the ``--execute`` flag) then conversion will continue and the output
  from any exception will be included in the cell output.

  ::

      jupyter nbconvert --to notebook --nbformat 3 mynotebook

  will create a copy of :file:`mynotebook.ipynb` in :file:`mynotebook.v3.ipynb`
  in version 3 of the notebook format.

  If you want to convert a notebook in-place,
  you can specify the ouptut file to be the same as the input file::

      jupyter nbconvert --to notebook mynb --output mynb

  Be careful with that, since it will replace the input file.

.. note::

  nbconvert uses pandoc_ to convert between various markup languages,
  so pandoc is a dependency when converting to latex or reStructuredText.

.. _pandoc: http://johnmacfarlane.net/pandoc/

The output file created by ``nbconvert`` will have the same base name as
the notebook and will be placed in the current working directory. Any
supporting files (graphics, etc) will be placed in a new directory with the
same base name as the notebook, suffixed with ``_files``::

  $ jupyter nbconvert notebook.ipynb
  $ ls
  notebook.ipynb   notebook.html    notebook_files/

For simple single-file output, such as html, markdown, etc.,
the output may be sent to standard output with::

  $ jupyter nbconvert --to markdown notebook.ipynb --stdout

Multiple notebooks can be specified from the command line::

  $ jupyter nbconvert notebook*.ipynb
  $ jupyter nbconvert notebook1.ipynb notebook2.ipynb

or via a list in a configuration file, say ``mycfg.py``, containing the text::

  c = get_config()
  c.NbConvertApp.notebooks = ["notebook1.ipynb", "notebook2.ipynb"]

and using the command::

  $ jupyter nbconvert --config mycfg.py
