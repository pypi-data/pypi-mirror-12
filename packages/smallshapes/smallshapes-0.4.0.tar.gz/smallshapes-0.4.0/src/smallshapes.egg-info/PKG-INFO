Description: `smallshapes` implements simple mathematical shapes and geometrical operations 
        in 2D, 3D and low dimensions. This library was created as in order to provide
        collision primitives to a game engine but may be useful in other contexts.
        
            * Implements AABB's, Circle and Convex Polygons.
            * TODO
