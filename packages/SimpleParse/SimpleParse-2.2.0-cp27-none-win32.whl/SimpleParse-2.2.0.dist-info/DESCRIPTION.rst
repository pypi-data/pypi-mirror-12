A Parser Generator for Python (w/mxTextTools derivative)

Provides a moderately fast parser generator for use with Python,
includes a forked version of the mxTextTools text-processing library
modified to eliminate recursive operation and fix a number of 
undesirable behaviours.

Converts EBNF grammars directly to single-pass parsers for many
largely deterministic grammars.
