        ==========
        mekk.fics
        ==========
        
        ``mekk.fics`` is a Python access library for FICS (freechess.org).
        It can be used to write FICS bots and clients in Python.
        
        Status
        ======
        
        The code works but is not finished.
        
        Core functionality (handling FICS connections, command management etc)
        works and is rather stable (it was extracted from WatchBot code and
        only slightly modified).
        
        Parsing routines (converting various FICS notifications and replies
        to commands) are implemented only for some commands and notifications.
        New parsers are mostly added on demand, whenever some new command or
        information turns out to be useful.
        
        Main APIs should be stable, data structures can be modified from time to time.
