PyPoi
=====

**PyPoi** is an image processing GUI program written in Python under
Apache License 2.0. PyPoi stands for "Python Program for Poisson Image
Editing".

It enables you to try the Poisson Image Editing method interactively.
Some examples are already ready for you, but you can also load arbitrary
images and try it.

Get Started
-----------

Well... no worries! If you're using **Windows** or **Mac OS**, you
simply need to download files and run it to try this program.

Simple installation
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

1. Go to `the release
   page <https://github.com/fbessho/PyPoi/releases>`__
2. From the latest version, download zip file (recommended) or
   executable file.
3. If you download zip file, extract the file in any folder, and double
   click

Run from repository (for developer)
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

You need to have **Python2.7** and pip installed before starting it. It
is recommended to use virtualenv. Please refer to `this
guide <http://docs.python-guide.org/en/latest/dev/virtualenvs/>`__ to
know how to install/use it if you're not familiar with it.

First of all, clone the repository

::

    git clone https://github.com/fbessho/PyPoi.git
    cd PyPoi

Then create a new virtualenv

::

    mkvirtualenv pypoi

Install required packages

::

    pip install -r requirements.txt

**If you get error in pyamg installation, please install numpy first by
the following command, and try the install command above again.**

::

    pip install $(grep numpy requirements.txt)
    # or
    # pip install numpy==1.8.1
    # or
    # pip install numpy

Alright, now you're ready to start. Try the following command. An
old-fashioned tkinter GUI should appear in front of you :beer:.

::

    cd pypoi
    python gui.py

What is Poisson Image Editing?
------------------------------

Poisson Image Editing is a technique to blend two images *seamlessly*.

This method is firstly introduced by Patrick PÃ©rez and others in ACM
SIGGRAPH 2003. The original theses is available `here
(pdf) <http://www.cs.princeton.edu/courses/archive/fall10/cos526/papers/perez03.pdf>`__.

Resources
~~~~~~~~~

There are many resources about Poisson Image Editing and I'll leave
explanations to them.

   Tralie <http://www.ctralie.com/Teaching/PoissonImageEditing/>`__

   -  **With many funny examples**.
   -  Hot discussion including technical details at the bottom too.
   -  Also contains Java implementation. Please see the chapter below.

Implementation in other languages
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

There have already been several implementation in other language. \*
`**Java** by Chris
Tralie <http://www.ctralie.com/Teaching/PoissonImageEditing/#tryit>`__
\* `**Python** by
parosky <https://github.com/parosky/poissonblending/>`__ \* As of
v0.1.0, core calculation is the copy of this implementation. \*
`**JavaScript** by takuti <http://takuti.me/dev/poisson/demo/>`__ \*
`Introduction in Japanese is available
too <http://blog.takuti.me/2013/12/poisson-image-blending/>`__ \*

What's next?
------------

I know there are a lot of space to improve. Main enhancements are listed
in `the issue tracker <https://github.com/fbessho/PyPoi/issues>`__, for
example, \* `#8 Gradient mixture
support <https://github.com/fbessho/PyPoi/issues/8>`__ \* `#3 Add
tests <https://github.com/fbessho/PyPoi/issues/3>`__ \* `#12 Calculation
speed improvement <https://github.com/fbessho/PyPoi/issues/12>`__

It's more than welcome if you can pick up one/some of them.
