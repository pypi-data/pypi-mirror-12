        Utilities for working with geodata with
        `Fiona <https://pypi.python.org/pypi/Fiona/1.5.0>`__. Some features are
        shorthand for `pyproj <https://pypi.python.org/pypi/pyproj>`__ features,
        or add in support for projections.
        
        Contents
        --------
        
        feature
        ~~~~~~~
        
        -  overlaps
        -  field\_contains\_test (test if a feature's properties has certain
           key:value pairs)
        -  togeojson (return a geojson-ready object)
        -  shapify
        -  length
        -  compound
        
        geometry
        ~~~~~~~~
        
        -  endpoints (for polyline features)
        -  startpoint (for polyline features)
        -  endpoint (for polyline features)
        -  bbox
        -  azimuth (between the start and end of a polyline)
        -  disjointed
        -  explodepoints
        -  explodesegments
        -  exploderings
        -  countpoints
        -  countsegments
        
        layer
        ~~~~~
        
        Most of these tools that mimic builtin python itertools.
        
        -  ffilter
        -  ffilterfalse
        -  fmap
        -  fchain
        -  freduce
        -  fslice
        -  fzip
        -  length Total length of linear features in a file's native projection
           or the given Proj object
        -  meta (records a layers meta attribute)
        -  bounds (returns a layer's bounds)
        -  find (return a feature that matches a particular key=value)
        
        measure
        ~~~~~~~
        
        -  distance (between two coordinates)
        -  azimuth (between two coordinates)
        -  signed\_area
        -  clockwise (shortcut for checking if signed\_area is >= 0)
        -  counterclockwise (shortcut for checking if signed\_area is < 0)
        -  azimuth\_distance (returns both azimuth and distance between two
           points)
