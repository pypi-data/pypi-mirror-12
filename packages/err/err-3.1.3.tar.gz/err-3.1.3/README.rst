Err
===

Err is a chatbot. It allows you to start scripts interactively from your chatrooms
for any reason: random humour, chatops, starting a build, monitoring commits, triggering
alerts...

It is written and easily extensible in Python.

Err is available as open source software and released under the GPL v3 license.

Contributions

Feel free to fork and propose changes on `github <https://www.github.com/gbin/err>`_

Prerequisites
-------------

Err runs under Python 3.3+ and Python 2.7 on Linux, Windows and Mac. For some chatting systems you'll need a key or a login for your bot to access it.

Installation
------------

If you can, we recommend to setup a `virtualenv <https://pypi.python.org/pypi/virtualenv>`_.

Err may be installed directly from PyPi using pip by issuing::

    pip install err

Or if you wish to try out the latest, bleeding edge version::

    pip install https://github.com/gbin/err/archive/master.zip


**Extra dependencies**

setup.py only installs the bare minimum dependencies needed to run Err.
Depending on the backend you choose, additional requirements need to be installed.

**Configuration**

After installing Err, you must create a data directory somewhere on your system where
config and data may be stored. Find the installation directory of Err, then copy the
file <install_directory>/errbot/config-template.py to your data directory as config.py

(If you installed Err via pip, the installation directory will most likely be
/usr/lib64/python<python_version_number>/site-packages/errbot)

Read the documentation within this file and edit the values as needed so the bot can
connect to your chosen backend (XMPP, Hipchat, Slack ...) server.

**Starting the daemon**

The first time you start Err, it is recommended to run it in foreground mode. This can
be done with::

    <path_to_install_directory>/errbot/err.py

In many cases, just typing ``errbot`` will be enough as it is generally added to the ``$PATH``
automatically. Please pass -h or --help to ``errbot`` to get a list of supported parameters.
Depending on your situation, you may need to pass --config or --backend when starting
Err.

If all that worked, you can now use the -d (or --daemon) parameter to run it in a
detached mode::

    <path_to_install_directory>/errbot/err.py --daemon

**Hacking on Err's code directly**

It's important to know that as of version 2.0, Err is written for Python 3. In order
to run under Python 2.7 the code is run through 3to2 at install time. This means that
while it is possible to run Err under Python 3.3+ directly from a source checkout, it
is not possible to do so with Python 2.7. If you wish to develop or test with Err's
code under 2.7, you must run::

    python setup.py develop

Interacting with the Bot
------------------------

After starting Err, you should add the bot to your buddy list if you haven't already.
You can now send commands directly to the bot, or issue commands in a chatroom that
the bot has also joined.

To get a list of all available commands, you can issue::

    !help full

If you just wish to know more about a specific command you can issue::

    !help command

**Managing plugins**

To get a list of public plugin repos you can issue::

    !repos

To install a plugin from this list, issue::

    !repos install <name of plugin>

You can always uninstall a plugin again with::

    !repos uninstall <plugin>

You will probably want to update your plugins periodically. This can be done with::

    !repos update all

Note: Please pay attention when you install a plugin, it may have additional
dependencies. If the plugin contains a requirements.txt then Err wil automatically
check them and warn you when you are missing dependencies.

Writing plugins
---------------

Writing your own plugins is extremely simple. As an example, this is all it takes
to create a "Hello, world!" plugin for Err::

   from errbot import BotPlugin, botcmd
   
    class Hello(BotPlugin):
        """Example 'Hello, world!' plugin for Err"""
   
        @botcmd
        def hello(self, msg, args):
            """Return the phrase "Hello, world!" to you"""
            return "Hello, world!"

This plugin will create the command "!hello" which, when issued, returns "Hello, world!"
to you. For more info on everything you can do with plugins, see the
`plugin development guide <http://errbot.io/user_guide/plugin_development/>`_.
