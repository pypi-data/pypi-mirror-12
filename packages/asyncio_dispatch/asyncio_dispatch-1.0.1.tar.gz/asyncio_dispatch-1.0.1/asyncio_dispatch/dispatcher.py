        *This method is a coroutine.*

        Connect a callback. By default, the callback will be called any time
        :meth:`asyncio_dispatch.Signal.send` is called. You may restrict this by adding ``senders``
        and/or ``keys`` which will cause the connected callback to only be called when
        :meth:`asyncio_dispatch.Signal.send` is called with a matching `sender` and/or ``key``.

        The difference between a ``sender`` and a ``key`` is that a ``sender`` refers to a specific
        object's location in memory and uses :func:`builtins.id` for comparison while a ``key``
        uses :func:`builtins.hash` for comparison. Thus two strings of the same value will always
        be equal when used as a ``key`` but may be seen as different objects when used as a
        ``sender``.


        :param callback: A callable to be called when the signal is sent
        :param Object sender: Any python object. Connects the callback to a single ``sender``.
        :param list senders: An iterable of ``sender`` objects. Connects the callback against
            multiple ``senders``.
        :param str key: Any object that can be used as a key in a python dictionary. Connects the
            callback against a single ``key``.
        :param list keys: An iterable of ``key`` objects. Connects the callback against multiple
            ``keys``.

            reference is required, use ``False``.
