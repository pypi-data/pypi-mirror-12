Description: collective.sitelogo
        ===================
        
        Set the site logo through the web. Works with ``lineage.registry``, so you can
        define site logos for Lineage subsites also.
        
        You have a "Site Logo" menu entry in the user menu and also a configlet in the
        ``@@overview-controlpanel`` form.
        
        This is a backport of the Plone 5 site logo feature. Also see:
