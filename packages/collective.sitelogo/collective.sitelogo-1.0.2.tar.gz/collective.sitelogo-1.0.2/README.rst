collective.sitelogo
===================

Set the site logo through the web. Works with ``lineage.registry``, so you can
define site logos for Lineage subsites also.

You have a "Site Logo" menu entry in the user menu and also a configlet in the
``@@overview-controlpanel`` form.

This is a backport of the Plone 5 site logo feature. Also see:
