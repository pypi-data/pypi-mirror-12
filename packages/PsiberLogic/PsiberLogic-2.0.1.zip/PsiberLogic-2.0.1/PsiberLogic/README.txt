Version 2.x has been released which contains major improvements and fixes, any users are
strongly encouraged toupgrade to this new version.

PsiberLogic is a speed-optimized fuzzy control package for Python 3.  Psibernetix is
an active contributor to the open-source movement and is happy to provide this package to
the amazing Python community.

PsiberLogic is a simplified, Cythonized, and compacted package that is a derivative work of Jose
Alexandre Nalon's excellent Peach package.  This was done for increases in computational efficiency
as well as to maintain the work by updating to Python 3.  This package is for anyone seeking a
high-performance, python3-callable package for creating fuzzy logic controllers.  PsiberLogic has
almost no checks for errors, if the format provided in the demo file is not followed correctly
errors could be present that will not be reported.  The goal of PsiberLogic is to be working
in the domain of microseconds.

Note that additional types of membership functions and defuzzification methods may be added
later, and additional speed optimizations are in development.  This has currently only been
tested for windows machines, but could work fine on OS X / Linux. Please feel free to
suggest improvements, send feedback, or inform the author of any bugs. (contact@psibernetix.com)

works of PsiberLogic must be as well.
