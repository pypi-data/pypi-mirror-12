ratebeer.py
===========

What is this?
-------------

`RateBeer <http://www.ratebeer.com/>`__ is a database of user-created
reviews about beers and breweries. However, their API has been down for
some time, making it difficult to get that information programmatically.
This simplifies that process, allowing you to access it in the most
painless way possible. Data is returned to you in a friendly, Pythonic
way:

.. code:: python

    >>> import ratebeer
    >>> rb = ratebeer.RateBeer()
    >>> rb.search('Summit')
    {'beers': [<Beer('/beer/21st-amendment-summit-ipa/61118/')>,
               <Beer('/beer/4ts-summit-hoppy/258783/')>,
               ...
               <Beer('/beer/karben4--summit-maccc-daddy-hophead-red-ale/264171/')>,
               <Beer('/beer/keroche-summit-lager/146462/')>],
     'breweries': [<Brewery('/brewers/sound-to-summit-brewing/22497/')>,
                   <Brewery('/brewers/summit-brewing-company/1233/')>,
                   ...
                   <Brewery('/brewers/summit-hard-cider-and-perry/18260/')>,
                   <Brewery('/brewers/summit-station-restaurant-brewery/346/')>]}

Why not BeerAdvocate.com?
-------------------------

Because they're evil, and they issue takedown notices left and right. We
like RateBeer. Scratch that, we **love** RateBeer.

Requirements
------------

Requires `requests[security] <https://pypi.python.org/pypi/requests>`__,
`beautifulsoup4 <https://pypi.python.org/pypi/beautifulsoup4/4.3.2>`__,
and `lxml <https://pypi.python.org/pypi/lxml/3.4.1>`__.

Installation
------------

Use ``pip``:

::

    pip install ratebeer

Or clone the package:

::

    git clone https://github.com/alilja/ratebeer.git

Usage
-----

Because ``ratebeer.py`` does not use an API, since one is not provided,
no key is required. Simply:

.. code:: python

    >>> import ratebeer
    >>> rb = ratebeer.RateBeer()
    >>> rb.search("summit extra pale ale")

``RateBeer`` Class
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

**Methods**

-  ``get_beer`` -- Pass in the URL for a beer page and this function
   will return a ``Beer`` object containing information about the beer.
   In addition the the URL, it accepts an optional ``fetch`` argument
   (default: False), which can be set to true to immediately download
   the object's attributes. See the ``Beer`` class below. You can
   replicate the ``RateBeer.beer(URL)`` functionality using
   ``RateBeer.get_beer(URL, True).__dict__``.

-  ``beer`` -- Returns a dictionary with information about that beer.

.. code:: python

    >>> rb.beer("/beer/new-belgium-tour-de-fall/279122/")
    {'_has_fetched': True,
     'abv': 6.0,
     'brewed_at': None,

     'weighted_avg': 3.34}

-  ``get_brewery`` -- Pass in the URL for a brewery page and this
   function will return a ``Brewery`` object containing information
   about that brewery. In addition the the URL, it accepts an optional
   ``fetch`` argument (default: False), which can be set to true to
   immediately download the object's attributes. See the ``Brewery``
   class below. You can replicate the ``RateBeer.brewery(URL)``
   functionality using ``RateBeer.get_brewery(URL, True).__dict__``.

-  ``brewery`` -- Returns a dictionary with information about the
   brewery. Includes a 'get\_beers()' generator that provides
   information about the brewery's beers.

     'web': 'http://www.deschutesbrewery.com/'}

-  ``search`` -- A generic search. A dictionary with two keys: beers and
   breweries. Each of those contains a list of objects, beers and
   breweries, respectively.

     'Witbier': '/beerstyles/witbier/48/',
     'Zwickel/Keller/Landbier': '/beerstyles/zwickel-keller-landbier/74/'}

-  ``beer_style`` -- Returns a generator of ``Beer`` objects from the
   beer style page. Takes a ``url`` to a beer style and an optional
   ``sort_type``: ``overall`` returns the highest-rated beers (default
   behavior) and ``trending`` returns, well, the trending beers.

.. code:: python

    >>> [b for b in rb.beer_style("/beerstyles/abbey-dubbel/71/")]
    [<Beer('/beer/st-bernardus-prior-8/2531/')>,

``Beer`` Class
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

``Beer`` requires the url of the beer you're looking for, like
``RateBeer.beer`` and ``RateBeer.get_beer``.

**Attributes**

-  ``abv`` (float): percentage alcohol
-  ``brewery`` (string): the name of the beer's brewery
-  ``brewery`` (Brewery object): the beer's brewery
-  ``brewed_at`` (Brewery object): actual brewery if contract brewed
-  ``calories`` (float): estimated calories for the beer
-  ``description`` (string): the beer's description
-  ``img_url`` (string): a url to an image of the beer
-  ``mean_rating`` (float): the mean rating for the beer (out of 5)
-  ``name`` (string): the full name of the beer (may include the brewery
   name)
-  ``num_ratings`` (int): the number of reviews
-  ``overall_rating`` (int): the overall rating (out of 100)
-  ``seasonal`` (string): Summer, Winter, Autumn, Spring, Series, Special, None
-  ``style`` (string): beer style
-  ``style_url`` (string): beer style URL

   some unknown algorithm (out of 5)

Any attributes not available will be returned as None

**Methods**

-  ``get_reviews`` -- Returns a generator of ``Review`` objects for all
   the reviews in the beer. Takes a ``review_order`` argument, which can
   be "most recent", "top raters", or "highest score".

``Review`` Class
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

``Review`` returns a datatype that contains information about a specific
review. For efficiency reasons, it requires the soup of the individual
review. Probably best to not try to make one yourself: use
``beer.get_reviews`` instead.

**Attributes**

-  ``appearance`` (int): rating for appearance (out of 5)
-  ``aroma`` (int): aroma rating (out of 10)
-  ``date`` (datetime): review date
-  ``overall`` (int): overall rating (out of 20, for some reason)
-  ``palate`` (int): palate rating (out of 5)
-  ``rating`` (float): another overall rating provided in the review.
   Not sure how this different from ``overall``.
-  ``taste`` (int): taste rating (out of 10)
-  ``text`` (string): actual text of the review.
-  ``user_location`` (string): writer's location
-  ``user_name`` (string): writer's username

``Brewery`` Class
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

``Brewery`` requires the url of the brewery you want information on.

**Attributes**

-  ``city`` (string): the brewery's city
-  ``country`` (string): the brewery's country
-  ``name`` (string): the brewery's name
-  ``postal_code`` (string): the brewery's postal code
-  ``state`` (string): the brewery's state/municipality/province
-  ``street`` (string): the street address of the brewery
-  ``telephone`` (string): the brewery's telephone number
-  ``type`` (string): the type of brewery. Typically "microbrewery" or
   "macrobrewery"
-  ``url`` (string): the url of the brewery's ratebeer page
-  ``web`` (string): the url of the brewery's homepage

**Methods**

-  ``get_beers`` -- Returns a generator of ``Beer`` objects for every
   beer produced by the brewery. Some brewery pages list beers that are
   produced by do not have any pages, ratings, or information besides a
   name. For now, these beers are omitted from the results.

Tests
-----

``ratebeer`` uses the standard Python unit testing library.

Changes
-------

Note that the nature of web scraping means this might break at **any**
time.

v2.3.1
~~~~

- Overhauled the Beer object so that it will be a little easier to fix with
  future changes. Beer object now also returns Brewery objects rather than
  strings for the brewery and brewed_at attributes. Also returns the url for the
  image of the beer and a list of user-assigned tags. The test.py file has been
  updated to be a bit clearer about where failures occur.

v2.3
~~~~

- Fixes to work with the new RateBeer search page.

v2.2.1
~~~~~~

-  ``Beer`` and ``Brewery`` objects are now "lazy", meaning they will
   not fetch the RateBeer page unless the requested attributes are not
   available. This should help minimize unnecessary requests.
-  ``RateBeer.search()`` now returns two lists of ``Beer`` and
   ``Brewery`` objects.
-  ``RateBeer.beer_style_list()`` now returns ``Beer`` and ``Brewery``
   objects.
-  ``Beer`` and ``Brewery`` objects now allow custom attributes to be
   set.

v2.1
~~~~

-  Bugfixes and performance enhancements.
-  Python 3 compatibility.

v2.0
~~~~

Major changes.

-  New ``Beer``, ``Review``, and ``Brewery`` classes.
-  Substantial overhaul in ``ratebeer.py``, addition of new files
   including separation of responsibilities
-  New generator functions in new classes.

v1.4
~~~~

-  ``reviews`` is now a generator.

v1.3.5
~~~~~~

-  Several improvements to results, particularly for edge cases and
   situations where search results are not in the expected order.

v1.3.4
~~~~~~

-  Metadata for beers returns floats when appropriate.

v1.3.3
~~~~~~

-  Captures more meta data.
-  Plays better with foreign beers.
-  Now if information is missing from a beer entry, its key is not added
   to the ``beer`` output.

v1.3.2
~~~~~~

-  Captures aliases for beer names.

v1.3
~~~~

-  Added ``beer_style_list`` and ``beer_style``.

v1.2
~~~~

-  Everything conforms to PEP8 now. Thanks to the fine folks
   `here <http://codereview.stackexchange.com/questions/69909/ratebeer-com-scraper>`__.
-  Minor refactoring.

v1.1
~~~~

-  Added ``reviews``.
-  Better exceptions (no more ``LookupError`` for 404s)

v1.0
~~~~

-  Initial release.
