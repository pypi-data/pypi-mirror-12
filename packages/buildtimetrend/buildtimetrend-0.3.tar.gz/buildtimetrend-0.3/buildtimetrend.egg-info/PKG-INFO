Description: Buildtime Trend generates and gathers timing data of build processes. The aggregated data is used to create charts to visualise trends of the build process.
        These trends can help you gain insight in your build process : which stages take most time? Which stages are stable or have a fluctuating duration? Is there a decrease or increase in average build duration over time?
        With these insights you can improve the stability of your build process and make it more efficient.
        
        The generation of timing data is done with either a client or using Buildtime Trend as a Service.
        The Python based client generates custom timing tags for any shell based build process and can easily be integrated. A script processes the generated timing tags when the build is finished, and stores the results.
        Buildtime Trend as a Service gets timing and build related data by parsing the logfiles of a buildprocess. Currently, Travis CI is supported. Simply trigger the service at the end of a Travis CI build and the parsing, aggregating and storing ofthe data is done automatically.
