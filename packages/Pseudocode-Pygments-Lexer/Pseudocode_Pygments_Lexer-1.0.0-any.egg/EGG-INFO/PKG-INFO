Description: # (French) Pseudocode syntax lexer for Pygments
        
        This package contains a Pygments Lexer for some basic pseudocode algorithmics.
        
        ## Installation
        
        The lexer is available as a Pip package:
        
            pip install pseudocode-pygments-parser
        
        Alternatively, to install from the git repository: (you may need to sudo depending on your Python environment)
        
            python setup.py install
        
        ## Usage
        
        After installation the Pseudocode lexer automatically registers itself for files with the `.algo` and `.pseudocode` extensions. Therefore, usage is easy:
        
            pygmentize document.algo
        
        You can also manally indicate you want to use the Pseudocode lexer by using a command line flag:
        
            pygmentize -l pseudocode somefile
