"""
Core functionality of the `executor` package.

If you're looking for an easy way to run external commands from Python take a
look at the :func:`execute()` function. When you need more flexibility consider
using the underlying :class:`ExternalCommand` class directly instead.

:func:`execute()` versus :class:`ExternalCommand`
-------------------------------------------------

In :mod:`executor` 1.x the :func:`execute()` function was the only interface
for external command execution. This had several drawbacks:

- The documentation for the :func:`execute()` function was getting way too
  complex given all of the supported options and combinations.

- There was no way to execute asynchronous external commands (running in the
  background) without sidestepping the complete :mod:`executor` module and
  going straight for :class:`subprocess.Popen` (with all of the verbosity
  that you get for free with :mod:`subprocess` :-).

- There was no way to prepare an external command without starting it
  immediately, making it impossible to prepare a batch of external commands
  before starting them (whether synchronously or asynchronously).

To solve these problems :mod:`executor` 2.x introduced the
:class:`ExternalCommand` class. This explains why :func:`execute()` is now a
trivial wrapper around :class:`ExternalCommand`: It's main purpose is to be an
easy to use shortcut that preserves compatibility with the old interface.

DEFAULT_SHELL = 'bash'
"""
The default shell used to evaluate shell expressions (a string).

This variable isn't based on the ``$SHELL`` environment variable because:

1. Shells like ``sh``, ``dash``, ``bash`` and ``zsh`` all have their own
   subtly incompatible semantics.
2. People regularly use shells like ``fish`` as their default login shell :-).

At an interactive prompt this is no problem (advanced users have obviously
learned to context switch) but when you're writing source code the last thing
you want to worry about is which shell is going to evaluate your commands! The
:mod:`executor` package expects this shell to support the following features:

- The ``-c`` option to evaluate a shell command provided as a command line
  argument.

- The ``-`` argument to instruct the shell to read shell commands from its
  standard input stream and evaluate those.

Apart from these two things nothing else is expected from the default shell so
you're free to customize it if you really want to write your shell commands in
``fish`` or ``zsh`` syntax :-).

              ==============================  ================================  =================================
    :raises: :exc:`ExternalCommandFailed` when the command exits with a
             nonzero exit code (unless :attr:`~ExternalCommand.capture` is
             :data:`False`).

    If :attr:`~ExternalCommand.async` is :data:`True` then :func:`execute()`
    will automatically start the external command for you using
    :func:`~ExternalCommand.start()` (but it won't wait for it to end). If you
    want to create an :class:`ExternalCommand` object instance without
    immediately starting the external command then you can use
    :class:`ExternalCommand` directly.

    **Some examples**

    By default the status code of the external command is returned as a boolean:

    >>> from executor import execute
    >>> execute('true')
    True

    If an external command exits with a nonzero status code an exception is raised,
    this makes it easy to do the right thing (never forget to check the status code
    of an external command without having to write a lot of repetitive code):

    >>> execute('false')
    Traceback (most recent call last):
      File "executor/__init__.py", line 124, in execute
        cmd.start()
      File "executor/__init__.py", line 516, in start
        self.wait()
      File "executor/__init__.py", line 541, in wait
        self.check_errors()
      File "executor/__init__.py", line 568, in check_errors
        raise ExternalCommandFailed(self)
    executor.ExternalCommandFailed: External command failed with exit code 1! (command: false)

    The exceptions raised by :func:`execute()` expose
    :attr:`~ExternalCommandFailed.command` and
    :attr:`~ExternalCommandFailed.returncode` attributes. If you know a command
    is likely to exit with a nonzero status code and you want
    :func:`execute()` to simply return a boolean you can do this instead:

    >>> execute('false', check=False)
    False
    """
    cmd = ExternalCommand(*command, **options)
    if cmd.async:
        cmd.start()

class ExternalCommand(PropertyManager):

    """
    Programmer friendly :class:`subprocess.Popen` wrapper.

    The :class:`ExternalCommand` class wraps :class:`subprocess.Popen` to make
    it easier to do the right thing (the simplicity of :func:`os.system()` with
    the robustness of :class:`subprocess.Popen`) and to provide additional
    features (e.g. asynchronous command execution that preserves the ability to
    provide input and capture output).

    Because the :class:`ExternalCommand` class has a lot of properties and
    methods here is a summary:

    **Writable properties**
     The :attr:`async`, :attr:`capture`, :attr:`capture_stderr`, :attr:`check`,
     :attr:`directory`, :attr:`encoding`, :attr:`environment`,
     :attr:`fakeroot`, :attr:`input`, :attr:`logger`, :attr:`merge_streams`,
     :attr:`silent`, :attr:`stdout_file`, :attr:`stderr_file`, :attr:`sudo` and
     :attr:`virtual_environment` properties allow you to configure how the
     external command will be run (before it is started).

    **Computed properties**
     The :attr:`command`, :attr:`command_line`, :attr:`decoded_stderr`,
     :attr:`decoded_stdout`, :attr:`encoded_input`, :attr:`error_message`,
     :attr:`error_type`, :attr:`failed`, :attr:`have_superuser_privileges`,
     :attr:`is_finished`, :attr:`is_running`, :attr:`is_terminated`,
     :attr:`output`, :attr:`returncode`, :attr:`stderr`, :attr:`stdout`,
     :attr:`succeeded` and :attr:`was_started` properties allow you to inspect
     if and how the external command was started, what its current status is
     and what its output is.

    **Public methods**
     The public methods :func:`start()`, :func:`wait()` and :func:`terminate()`
     enable you to start external commands, wait for them to finish and
     terminate them if they take too long.

    **Internal methods**
     The internal methods :func:`check_errors()`, :func:`load_output()` and
     :func:`cleanup()` are used by :func:`start()`, :func:`wait()` and
     :func:`terminate()` so unless you're reimplementing one of those methods
     you probably don't need these internal methods.

    **Context manager**
      :class:`ExternalCommand` objects can be used as context managers by using
      the :keyword:`with` statement:

      - When the scope of the :keyword:`with` statement starts the
        :func:`start()` method is called (if the external command
        isn't already running).
      - When the scope of the :keyword:`with` statement ends
        :func:`terminate()` is called if the command is still running. The
        :func:`load_output()` and :func:`cleanup()` functions are used to
        cleanup after the external command. If an exception isn't already being
        raised :func:`check_errors()` is called to make sure the external
        command succeeded.
