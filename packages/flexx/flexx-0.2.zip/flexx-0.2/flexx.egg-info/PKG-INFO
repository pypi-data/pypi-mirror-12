Description: 
        Flexx is a pure Python toolkit for creating
        graphical user interfaces (GUI's), that uses web technology for its
        rendering. You can use Flexx to create desktop applications, web
        applications, and (if designed well) export an app to a standalone HTML
        document. It also works in the Jupyter notebook.
        
        Being pure Python and cross platform, it should work anywhere where
        there's Python and a browser. To run apps in desktop-mode, we recommend having Firefox
        installed.
        
        Flexx has a modular design, consisting of a few subpackages, which can
        also be used by themselves:
        
        * ui - the widgets
        * app - the event loop and server
        * react - reactive programming (how information flows through your program)
        * pyscript - Python to JavaScript transpiler
        * webruntime - to launch a runtime
        
        For more information, see http://flexx.readthedocs.org.
