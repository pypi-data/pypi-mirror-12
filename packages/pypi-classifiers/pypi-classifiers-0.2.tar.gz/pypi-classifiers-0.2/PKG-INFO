Description: PyPI classifiers selector
        =========================
        
        A small GTK program that loads a list of classifiers from PyPI, displays them
        in a list with checkboxes. The user can then check any number of checkboxes
        and the program will generate code suitable to copy & paste into a setup.py
        script.

        Installation
        ------------
        
        ``pypi-classifiers`` has three dependencies: GTK, Glib and `requests
        <python-requests.org>`_. Most Linux desktop-oriented Linux distros ship these
        as packages, which are often installed by default. Beyond this, the script is
        self-contained; instead of installing into a virtualenv, it maybe possible to
        just copy
        `pypi-classifiers
        <https://raw.githubusercontent.com/mbr/pypi-classifiers/master/pypi-classifiers>`_
        somewhere and run it::
        
            ./pypi-classifiers
        
        PyPI
        ~~~~
        
        Installation from PyPI works as well (and will install the potentially missing
        ``requests`` dependency), although Gtk should be installed using your
        distributions package manager (remember to ``toggleglobalsitepackages``).
