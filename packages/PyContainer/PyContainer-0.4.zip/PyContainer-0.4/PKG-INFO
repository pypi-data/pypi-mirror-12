Description: PyContainer is a simple Python implementation of an
        Inversion of Control (Dependency Injection) lightweight container.
        Lightweight containers make it easier to build well-organized, component
        based applications by managing all dependencies of the components. This
        makes it unnecessary to include any implementation-specific component
        object creation code in the components. Applications are more flexible and
        components more reusable.
        PyContainer supports container hierarchies, interceptors and lifecycle
        management. It is configured through XML file. The distribution includes
        the pxdom module required in some envrionments (license details in
        license.txt).
