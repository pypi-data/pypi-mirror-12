Tutorials
=========

* `Tutorial 1 - Getting Started <http://nbviewer.ipython.org/urls/bitbucket.org/cmutel/brightway2/raw/2.0/notebooks/Tutorial%201%20-%20Getting%20Started.ipynb>`_

After doing the tutorials, you should have an idea of what is possible with Brightway2. The rest of the manual will help explain its components in more detail, but is not really fun to read through in one sitting. It is more of a reference work than a page turner.

You are ready to start exploring, and the manual will try to help you when you get lost.

Importing data: example notebooks
---------------------------------

Importing data can be difficult, due to data incompatibilities between different software implementations. Here are some notebooks that show the steps needed to import various databases.
