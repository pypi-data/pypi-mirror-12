        django-notify-x: quick guide
        ============================
        
        Django NotifyX is a reusable app which adds notification system features to your Django app.
        
        It was inspired from `django-notifications`_ , major differences include:
            - Multipe user notification at once.
            - A different approch for notification updates.
            - Less hassles when trying to format notifications differently accoring to their types.
            - AJAX support for everything.
            - And many more.
        
        This is just a quick guide to get things to work ASAP. To dive into the details.. `Read the docs`_
        
        How to install
        ==============
        
        Downloading the package
        -----------------------
        
        Probably the best way to install is by using `PIP`::
            $ pip install django-notify-x
        
        If you want to stay on the bleeding edge of the app::
            $ git clone https://github.com/v1k45/django-notify-x.git
            $ cd django-notify-x
            $ python setup.py install
        
        Installing it on your project
        -----------------------------
        
        After the you've installed ``django-notify-x`` in your python enviroment. You have to make an entry of the same in your project ``settings.py`` file::
        
            INSTALLED_APPS = (
                ...
                'your.other.apps',
                ...
                'notify'.
            )
        
        Then an entry on the ``urls.py`` file::
        
            urlpatterns = (
                url(r'^notifications/', include('notify.urls', 'notifications')),
            )
        
        Then run migrations::
        
            $ python manage.py migrate notify
        
        Then ``collectstatic`` to make sure you've copied the JS file for AJAX functionality::
        
            $ python manage.py collectstatic
        
        You've successfully installed ``django-notify-x``!
        
        Sending notifications
        =====================
        
        Sending notifications to single user
        ------------------------------------
        
        .. code-block:: python
        
            from notify.signals import notify
        
            # your example view
            def follow_user(request, user):
                user = User.objects.get(username=user)
                ...
                dofollow
                ...
        
                notify.send(request.user, recipient=user, actor=request.user
                            verb='followed you.', nf_type='followed_by_one_user')
        
                return YourResponse
        
        
        Easy as pie, isn't it?
        
        Sending notifications to to multiple users:
        -------------------------------------------
        
        .. code-block:: python
        
            from notify.signals import notify
        
            # your example view
            def upload_video(request):
                ...
                uploadvideo...
                ...
                video = VideoUploader.getupload()
                followers = list(request.user.followers())
        
                notify.send(request.user, recipient_list=followers, actor=request.user
                            verb='uploaded.', target=video, nf_type='video_upload_from_following')
        
                return YourResponse
        
        Just change the ``recipient`` to ``recipient_list`` and send notifications to as many users you want!
        
        .. warning::
             ``recipient_list`` expects supplied object to be a list() instance, make sure you convert your ``QuerySet`` to list() before assigning vaule.
        
        Notification Template tags
        ==========================
        
        This app comes with two notification tags, one renders notifications for you and the other includes javascript variables and functions relating the ``notifyX.js`` file.
        
        render_notifications
        --------------------
        
            As its name reflects, it will render notifications for you. ``render_notifications`` will take at least one parameter and maximum two parameters.
        
            You can use them to render notifications using a ``Notification`` QuerySet object, like this::
        
                {% load notification_tags %}
                {% render_notifications using request.user.notifications.active %}
        
            By default, the above tag will render notifications on the notifications page and not on the notification box. So it will use a template corresponing to it's ``nf_type`` with a ``.htm`` suffix nothing more.
        
            To render notificatons on a notifications box::
                
                {% load notification_tags %}
                {% render_notifications using request.user.notifications.active for box %}
        
            This tag will look for template name with ``_box.html`` suffixed when rendering notification contents.
        
            The ``request.user.notifications.active`` is just used to show an example of notification queryset, you can use any other way to supply a QuerySet of your choice.
        
        include_notify_js_variables
        ---------------------------
        
            This tag uses ``notifications/includes/js_variables.html`` to include a template populated with JS variables and functions. You can override the values of any JS variables by creating your own version of ``js_variables.html`` template.
        
            To include JS variables for AJAX notification support, do this::
        
                {% load notification_tags %}
                {% if user.is_authenticated %}
                    {% include_notify_js_variables %}
                {% endif %}
        
            This template inclusion includes three javascript files from the template includes directory, they are::
        
                mark_success.js
                mark_all_success.js
                delete_success.js
                update_success.js
        
            All of them are nothing but javascript function declarations which are supposed to run when a JQuery AJAX request is successfully completed.
        
        And other things...
        ===================
        
        It will be best to `Read the Docs`_ instead of expecting every thing from a quick guide :)
