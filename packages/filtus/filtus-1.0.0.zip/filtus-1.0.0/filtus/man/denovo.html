<h2 id="description" style="color: black;">Description</h2><p>
Identification of <em>de novo</em> variants in a trio (child + both parents). Posterior de novo probabilities are computed using a Baysian approach.
</p>

<h2 id="prerequisites" style="color: black;">Prerequisites</h2><p>
To apply the <em>de novo</em>
algorithm in FILTUS, the following requirements should be met:
<ul>
<li>The variants of the trio should be contained in <span style="font-style: italic;">a single file</span> containing all three samples. Joint variant
calling is highly recommended.</li>
<li>The variant file must have VCF-like genotype
columns, with the correct FORMAT column indicated in the <a href="loading.html#inputsettings">input settings dialog</a>.</li>
<li>The FORMAT column (the one with entries like
GT:AD:DP:GQ:PL) must contain the fields GT, AD and PL, which
are all used in the algorithm.</li>
<li>The variant file must be loaded with the <span style="font-style: italic;">keep 0/0</span> option
checked in the <a href="loading.html#inputsettings">input
settings dialog</a>.</li>
</ul>

<p><em>NOTE: If your variant files don't meet the above requirements, there may still be hope! In many cases you can identify potential <em>de novo</em> variants using the 
<a href="familybased.html#inputsettings">family based filter</a> with a dominant model (follow the link to see details). For instance, if all you have are individual variant files for a child and both parents, 
this would be the thing to do. The downside is that you wouldn't get posterior probabilities - or any other meassure of classification strength - and probably quite a few more false positives.

<h2 id="dialog" style="color: black;">Dialog</h2>
<div style="text-align: center;"><img alt="De novo dialog" height="340" src="pictures/denovo.png"><br></div>

<p>To open the <em>de novo</em>
dialog, choose <span style="font-style: italic;">De novo
variant detection</span> in the <span style="font-style: italic;">Analysis</span> menu. Any
filters (e.g. PASS) should be applied before opening the dialog. The entry points of the dialog are as follows:
</p>

<dl>
<dt><strong>
Trio samples
</strong></dt><dd>
Indicate the sample numbers (corresponding to the sample
order in the <span style="font-style: italic;">Loaded
samples</span> window in the main Filtus area.) Alternatively,
you can use the syntax <kbd>ID &lt;string&gt;</kbd> where
<kbd>&lt;string&gt;</kbd> is a unique identifier for the sample name (as
given in the variant file). For example, if the sample name of the
child is "Trio1_child" you can write <kbd>ID child</kbd>. If the string is not
unique (i.e. if there are multiple loaded sample names containing
"child"), you will be warned.
</dd><br>
<dt><strong>
Mutation rate
</strong></dt><dd>
This is used in the algorithm as the prior probability of a mutation at
a given position in a single meiosis. Default value: 1e-8. The
algorithm is usually not very sensitive to this parameter, but the
posterior probabilities will be affected if you change it radically.
</dd><br>

<dt><strong>
Allele frequencies
</strong></dt><dd>
Indicate a column containing frequencies for
the ALT alleles. The <span style="font-style: italic;">Missing
entry value</span> is substituted whenever the column does not
contain a number. If your variant file does not have frequency data,
the <span style="font-style: italic;">Missing entry value</span>
will be used for all variants. Without correct frequencies, the program
will still identify the same potential <em>de novo</em> variants,
but the posterior probabilies may be less accurate.<br><br>
NB: For multiallelic variants, the frequency column is ignored. As a
result, any multiallelic variants detected by the de novo algorithm
gets a missing posterior probability ('-'). Since the output is sorted
on the posterior probability, these will end up at the bottom of the
list.
</dd><br>

<dt><strong>
Output filters
</strong></dt><dd>
The purpose of these filters is to reduce the
number of false positives in the output. A true heterozygous de novo
variant is expected to present with ALT/REF ratio close to 50% in the
child, and 0% in the parents. In practice some slack is recommended,
e.g. child &gt; 30% and parents &lt; 5%.<br><br>
One may experiment
with these filters for other purposes too: For example, to look for de
novo mosiac variants in the child one could try a very loose cutoff for
the child, e.g. child &gt; 10%, while requiring parents = 0%. Or
oppositely, for variants inherited from a mosaic parent, something like
parents &lt; 25% and child &gt; 40% would be sensible, without
including too much garbage. Of course, these are merely
suggestions whose validity depend heavily on the actual
contents of the variant file. (E.g. the quality of the
variants and the parameters of the variant calling.) </dd><br>

Summary
</strong></dt><dd>
A summary of the findings is printed here. The identified variants are shown in the main Filtus window; to inspect them you must close the de novo dialog.

<h2 id="tips" style="color: black;">Practical tips</h2>
<p><em>Tip 1:</em> 
To save the results, first close the de novo dialog, and then select Save main window content in the File menu.</p>
<p><em>Tip 2:</em> 
When browsing variants in the main Filtus window, you can right click on any particular variant to see details about that variant for all the samples.</p>
