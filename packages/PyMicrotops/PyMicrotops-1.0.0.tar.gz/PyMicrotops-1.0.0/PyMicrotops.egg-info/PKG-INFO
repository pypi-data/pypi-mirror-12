Description: # PyMicrotops
        
        This is a Python module to simplify working with data from the Microtops sun photometer.
        
        There are two principal functions at the moment:
        
        1) Processing Microtops data files (including interpolating AOT at other wavelengths)
        
        2) Reading Microtops data from the instrument over a serial connection, and
        saving/processing the data.
        
        The module is fairly well documented with docstrings, so a fairly quick example should be all that's needed:
        
        ```python
        from PyMicrotops import Microtops
        m = Microtops(microtopsfile.csv)
        # Plot all of the AOT data
        m.plot()
        # Plot for a specific time period
        m.plot('2014-07-10','2014-07-19')
        # Get AOT at a specific wavelength - interpolating if needed
        m.aot(550)
        ```
