Description: PyMicrotops
        ===========
        
        This is a Python module to simplify working with data from the Microtops
        sun photometer.
        
        The functionality is split into two parts at the moment:
        
        1) Processing Microtops data files (including interpolating AOT at other
           wavelengths)
        
        2) Reading Microtops data from the instrument over a serial connection,
           and saving/processing the data.
        
        PyMicrotops is available on PyPI, so install by running
        ``pip install PyMicrotops``
        
        The module is fairly well documented with docstrings, so a fairly quick
        example should be all that's needed:
        
        .. code:: python
        
            from PyMicrotops import Microtops
            m = Microtops('microtopsfile.csv')
            # Plot all of the AOT data
            m.plot()
            # Plot for a specific time period
            m.plot('2014-07-10','2014-07-19')
            # Get AOT at a specific wavelength - interpolating if needed
            m.aot(550)
        
        You can also run the ``read_microtops`` command from the command-line
        which will read and save Microtops data from a connected instrument. If
        no command-line parameters are given then it will use a simple
        command-line user-interface, alternatively the port to use and the
        filename to save to can be given as arguments.
