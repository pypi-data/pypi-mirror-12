        Django-bsync
        =================
        
        Forked from Django-livereload
        
        Application performing a `browser-sync`_ once the development
        server is ready.
        
        Why this project ?
        ------------------
        
        I recently started using `Gulp`_ and `browser-sync`_ to automatize some
        tasks. Everytime an HTML, CSS or JS file changes, a bsync is performed in
        the browser to reflect those changes, and I was pretty happy with that.
        
        But I found one limitation, I cannot perform a bsync of the current
        page when editing Python files because the development server provided by
        Django is not necessary ready as soon as the bsync request is emitted.
        
        That's why I created this application.
        
        Installation
        ------------
        
        * First install the package on your system: ::
        
          $ pip install django-bsync
        
        * Then register the ``'bsync'`` application in your ``INSTALLED_APPS``
          setting, before the ``'django.contrib.staticfiles'`` application if used.
        
        Usage
        -----
        
        Install `browser-sync` globally ::
        
         $ npm install -g browser-sync
        
        If the bsync server provided by `browser-sync` is launched (via `Gulp`_,
        `Grunt`_ or whatever), the ``runserver`` command will do a browser-sync reload on
        your browser whenever the Django development server is ready.
