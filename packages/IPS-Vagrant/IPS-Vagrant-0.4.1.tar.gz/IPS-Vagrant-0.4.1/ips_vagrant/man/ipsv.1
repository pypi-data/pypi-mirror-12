.SH SYNOPSIS
.sp
ipsv [OPTIONS] COMMAND [ARGS]...
.SH INTRODUCTION
.sp
This custom Vagrant box utility was designed specifically with
\fI\%Invision Power Suite\fP third party
developers in mind. It aims to make developing IPS applications and plugins
a more enjoyable experience by eliminating the headache of having to manage
and manually configure a local development environment using WAMP
or similar means.
.sp
But it\(aqs not only for developers. ipsv provides average end users
with an easy way to test new releases of Invision Power Suite without
needing to know how to set up a local testing server or requiring a
third party hosting service.
.SS What is Vagrant?
.sp
\fI\%Vagrant\fP is software for managing
virtual development environments. It allows you to easily create and
destroy virtual machines on the fly.
.SS What is ipsv?
.sp
ipsv is a custom server and configuration file management
application that comes pre\-installed on the
\fI\%FujiMakoto/ipsv\fP
Vagrant box.
.SH DOCUMENTATION
.SS Getting started
.sp
To get started working with IPS\-Vagrant, you will need to set up a new
Vagrant box.
.sp
If you haven\(aqt already, install
\fI\%Vagrant\fP and
\fI\%VirtualBox\fP now.
.nf
Next, download the latest release of IPS\-Vagrant and extract the
contents to a dedicated Vagrant folder,
\fI\%https://github.com/FujiMakoto/IPS\-Vagrant/releases\fP
.fi
.sp
.sp
This is the directory where all of your HTTP files and projects will be
saved by default.
.sp
After the files have been extracted, open up your terminal (or
PowerShell if you\(aqre on Windows) and navigate to the directory where you
extracted the Vagrant files, then run the command \fBvagrant up\fP\&.
.sp
This will automatically download and import the custom Vagrant box and
run all necessary setup tasks for you.
.sp
Once the Vagrant box has been downloaded and set up, you\(aqll be able to
immediately connect to the box by running the \fBvagrant ssh\fP command if
you\(aqre on Linux/OSX.
.sp
If you\(aqre on Windows, you\(aqll need to use a dedicated SSH client such as
\fI\%PuTTY\fP\&.
(You connect to 127.0.0.1 on port 2222 with "vagrant" as the
username/password combination by default).
.SS Running Commands
.sp
All IPS\-Vagrant administrative commands can be accessed using the
\fBipsv\fP commandline application. Running the command without any
arguments will bring up the help page,

IPS installations are stored in the \fBversions/ips\fP folder in your
Vagrant path.
.sp
To add a new version for installation, just copy the IPS installation
.zip archive into this directory. You don\(aqt need to do anything to make
it recognizable to ipsv, it should work with any non\-beta installation
package as is, regardless of the filename.
.sp
To install a custom IPS version, just use the \-\-version flag with the
new command.
.sp
For example, \fBipsv new \-\-version="4.0.11"\fP
.sp
Developer Tool resources are stored in the \fBversions/dev_tools\fP
directory in your Vagrant path. Unlike with IPS versions, these are
selected automatically based on the IPS version you install.
.sp
The installation script will try and use the matching Developer Tools
version if it\(aqs available. If not, it will elicit a warning during
installation and will use the closest available version instead.
.sp
Please note that the script can \fB*not*\fP currently automatically
download the Developer Tools resource, as IPS\(aq community website
currently blocks unrecognized web crawlers and scrapers (including
ipsv).
.sp
Because of this, in order to automatically install and enable IN_DEV
mode with your installation, you will have to manually download the
latest Developer Tools resource and copy it to the dev_tools path
specified above. You will also need to pass the \fB\-\-dev\fP flag with the
ipsv new command.
.SS Enabling installations
.sp
When working with multiple installations under the same domain name, you
will want to be able to easily cycle between them. This is where the
enable command comes in handy.

Usage: ipsv delete [OPTIONS] <domain> <site>

  Deletes a single site if both <domain> and <site> are specified, or ALL sites

Options:
  \-\-remove\-code / \-\-preserve\-code
                                  Deletes project code (HTTP files) with the site
                                  entry. (Default: Preserve)

When both a domain and site name are provided, the command will delete a

\fB\-\-remove\-code\fP option is provided, the script will delete all HTTP
files with the site entry. You will be required to re\-input the
site/domain name when utilizing this option as an additional safety
measure.
