IPS-Vagrant
===========

Introduction
------------

Welcome to the IPS Vagrant development box!

This custom Vagrant box was designed specifically with `Invision Power
Suite <https://www.invisionpower.com>`__ third party developers in mind.
It aims to make developing IPS applications and plugins a more enjoyable
experience by eliminating the headache of having to manage and manually
configure a local development environment using WAMP or similar means.

But it's not only for developers. IPS Vagrant provides average end users
with an easy way to test new releases of Invision Power Suite without
needing to know how to set up a local testing server or requiring a
third party hosting service.
