        **NOTE: This plug-in currently could NOT be installed. We are working on resolving the issue; until then if curious you can install it [from source](https://github.com/biolab/orange3-text) but beware that it is still in development.**
        
        Orange3 Text extends Orange with common functionality for text mining. It provides access
        to publicly available data, like NY Times, Twitter and PubMed. Further,
        it provides tools for preprocessing, constructing vector spaces (like
        bag-of-words, topic modeling and word2vec) and visualizations like word cloud
        end geo map. All features can be combined with powerful data mining techniques
        from the Orange data mining framework.
