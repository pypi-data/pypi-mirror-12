        Todoman is a simple, standards-based, cli todo (aka: task) manager. Todos
        are stored into `icalendar <https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc5545>`_ files, which
        means you can sync them via `CalDAV <http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CalDAV>`_
        using, for example, `vdirsyncer <https://vdirsyncer.readthedocs.org/>`_.
        
        Official website and repository is hosted at `GitLab.com
        <https://gitlab.com/hobarrera/todoman>`_.
        
        Features
        --------
        
        * Listing, editing and creating todos.
        * Todos are read from individual ics files from the configured directory. This
          matches the `vdir <https://vdirsyncer.readthedocs.org/en/latest/vdir.html>`_
          specification.
        * There's support for the most common TODO features for now (summary,
          description, location, due date and priority) for now.
        * Todoman should run on any major operating system.
        * Unsupported fields may not be shown but are *never* deleted or altered.
