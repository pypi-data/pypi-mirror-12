Description: # hmac_authentication Python package
        
        Signs and authenticates HTTP requests based on a shared-secret HMAC signature.
        
        Developed in parallel with the following packages for other languages:
        - Go: [github.com/18F/hmacauth](https://github.com/18F/hmacauth/)
        - Ruby: [hmac_authentication](https://rubygems.org/gems/hmac_authentication)
        - Node.js: [hmac-authentication](https://www.npmjs.com/package/hmac-authentication)
        
        ## Installation
        
        ```sh
        $ pip install hmac-authentication
        ```
        
        ## Validating incoming requests
        
        Inject something resembling the following code fragment into your request
        handling logic as the first thing that happens before the request body is
        parsed, where `headers` is a list of headers factored into the signature and
        `secret_key` is the shared secret between your application and the service
        making the request:
        
        _...coming soon..._
        
        ## Signing outgoing requests
        
        _...coming soon..._
        
        ## Running tests
        
        ```sh
        $ pip install nose
        $ nosetests
        ```
