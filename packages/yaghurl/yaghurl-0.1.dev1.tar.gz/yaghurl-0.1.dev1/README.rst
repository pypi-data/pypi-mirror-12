=========

Yet another github URL tool. Pronounced like one is hurling a yag.

My goal for this is to hook up my emacs so that a keystroke will insert
a github comment reference to the current file, line, commit, and
branch. As much functionality as possible should be pushed into the
``yaghurl.py`` python script, for reuse in other editors or from the
shell. Editor integrations should live in ``./contrib``.
