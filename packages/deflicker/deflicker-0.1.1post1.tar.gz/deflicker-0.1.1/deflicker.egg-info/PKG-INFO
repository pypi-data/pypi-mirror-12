Description: Image Deflickering for Timelapse Videos
        =======================================
        
        After I made my first few timelapse videos I got really bothered by the
        erratic small changes of exposure, which are caused by various effects:
        \* Changes of the exposure settings (if not in full manual mode) \*
        Uncertainties of the aperture \* Shutter jitter
        
        I was looking for an existing solution and only found expensive
        (O(100â‚¬)) software.
        
        So I wrote this little (150 SLOCS) programm. The brightness of the
        images are adjusted to fit a rolling mean over several consecutive
        images.
        
        Installation
        ------------
        
        I recommend anaconda, it comes with the heavy dependencies of this
        package: ``numpy`` and ``scikit-image``
        
        Installation of ``deflicker``:
        
        ::
        
            $ pip install deflicker
        
        Usage
        -----
        
        ``deflicker`` expects all your pictures in one directory. The
        alphabetical order has to be equivalent to the chronological order.
        
        ::
        
            deflicker <inputfolder> [options]
        
        Options
        ~~~~~~~
        
        -  ``-o <dir>, --outdir=<dir>`` Output directory [default: deflickered]
        -  ``-w <N>, --window=<N>`` Window size for rolling mean [default: 10]
        -  ``-q, --quiet`` Only output errors and warnings
        -  ``-f <fmt>, --format=<fmt>`` Output format for the scaled images
           [default: png]
        -  ``-s <s>, --sigma=<s>`` Sigma for the sigma clipping
