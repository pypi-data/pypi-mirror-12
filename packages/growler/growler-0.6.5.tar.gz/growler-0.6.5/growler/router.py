    The router class holds all the 'routes': callbacks connected assigned to
    HTTP method and regular expression pairs. If a regex matches with the
    request's path member, the callback is called with the req, res pair.

    Routes are added on a per-method basis, using the router.*method*(path, cb)
    syntax, for example:
        router.get("/home", cb)
    will call cb(req, res) upon every incoming HTTP connection with the request
    line: GET /home HTTP/1.1. To catch all methods, use the 'router.all'
    member.

    Routers can be linked together in a tree-like structure using the member
    'use'. so components of websites can be developed in their own "namespace"
    and mounted to the website on its own path:
        blog_router.get("/list", ...)
        blog_router.post("/new_post", ...)

        root_router.use("/blog", blog_router)

    The default growler.App has its root router at self.router, and offers
    convience aliases to automatically add routes:
        app.get(..) == app.router.get(...)
