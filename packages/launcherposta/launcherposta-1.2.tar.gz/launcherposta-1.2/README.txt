Welcome to the Launcher Posta project!

This is a simple program that lives in the systray and lets you launch applications (posta!).

To execute it, just do:

  $ bin/launcherposta


Unity does not allow any applications to show in the systray, which can be configured through dconf in 'desktop.unity.panel.systray-whitelist'. This program will check this setting and fix it automatically if needed.
