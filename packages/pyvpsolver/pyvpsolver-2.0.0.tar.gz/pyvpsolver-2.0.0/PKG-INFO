Description: 
        VPSolver
        --------
        VPSolver is a vector packing solver based on an arc-flow formulation
        with graph compression. VPSolver generates very strong models that can
        be solved using general-purpose mixed-integer programming solvers such
        as Gurobi and GLPK. For modelling other problems easily, VPSolver
        includes a Python API and a modelling toolbox (PyMPL).
