============
Introduction
============
The module is a massively parallel implementation of the Trotter-Suzuki approximation to simulate the evolution of quantum systems classically. It relies on interfacing with C++ code with OpenMP for multicore execution.

Key features of the Python interface:

* Fast execution by parallelization: OpenMP.
* NumPy arrays are supported for efficient data exchange.
* Multi-platform: Linux, OS X, and Windows are supported.
* Arbitrary single-body initial state with closed and periodic boundary conditions.
* Many-body simulations with non-interacting particles.
* `Gross-Pitaevskii equation <https://github.com/Lucacalderaro/Master-Thesis/blob/master/Soliton%20generation%20on%20Bose-Einstein%20Condensate.ipynb>`_.
* Imaginary time evolution to calculate the ground state.

The `original high-performance kernels <https://bitbucket.org/zzzoom/trottersuzuki>`_ were developed by Carlos Bederi√°n. The distributed extension was carried out while `Peter Wittek <http://peterwittek.com/>`_ was visiting the `Department of Computer Applications in Science \& Engineering <http://www.bsc.es/computer-applications>`_ at the `Barcelona Supercomputing Center <http://www.bsc.es/>`_, funded by the "Access to BSC Facilities" project of the `HPC-Europe2 <http://www.hpc-europa.org/>`_ programme (contract no. 228398). Generalizing the capabilities of kernels was carried out by Luca Calderaro while visiting the `Quantum Information Theory Group <https://www.icfo.eu/research/group_details.php?id=19>`_ at `ICFO-The Institute of Photonic Sciences <https://www.icfo.eu/>`_, sponsored by the `Erasmus+ <http://ec.europa.eu/programmes/erasmus-plus/index_en.htm>`_ programme.
