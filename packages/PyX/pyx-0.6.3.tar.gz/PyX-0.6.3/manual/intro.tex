\chapter{Introduction}
\label{intro}

\PyX{} is a Python package for the creation of vector drawings. As
such it allows one to readily generate encapsulated PostScript files
by providing an abstraction of the PostScript graphics model.  Based
on this layer and in combination with the full power of the Python
language itself, the user can just code any complexity of the figure
wanted. \PyX{} distinguishes itself from other similar solution by its
\TeX{}/\LaTeX{} interface that enables one to make directly use of the
famous high quality typesetting of these programs.

A major part of \PyX{} on top of the already described basis is the
provision of high level functionality for complex tasks like 2d plots
in publication-ready quality.

\section{Organisation of the \PyX{} package}

The \PyX{} package is split in several modules, which can be
categorised in the following groups

\begin{tableii}{l|l}{textrm}{Functionality}{Modules}
  basic graphics functionality &   \module{canvas}, \module{path}, \module{deco}, \module{style}, \module{color},
  and \module{connector}
  \\
  text output via \TeX{}/\LaTeX{} &   \module{text} and \module{box}
  \\
  linear transformations and units &   \module{trafo} and \module{unit}
  \\
  graph plotting functionality &  \module{graph} (including sub modules)
  and \module{graph.axis} (including sub modules)
  \\
  EPS file inclusion & \module{epsfile}
\end{tableii}

These modules (and some other less import ones) are imported into the
module namespace by using 
\begin{verbatim}
from pyx import *
\end{verbatim}
at the beginning of your Python program.  However, in order to prevent
namespace pollution, you may also simply use \samp{import pyx}.
Throughout this manual, we shall always assume that former import line
form has been used.
