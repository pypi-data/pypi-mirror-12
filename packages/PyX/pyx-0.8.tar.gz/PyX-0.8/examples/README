The following examples are part of the \PyX{} release __version__. For each
\PyX{} example the source code and the corresponding output are shown. Please
pay attention to source code comments within the examples for further
information.

The examples typically end with "writeEPSfile" and "writePDFfile" method
calls to create both, a PostScript and a PDF version of the example. Usually
you want to create just one of the two choices.
