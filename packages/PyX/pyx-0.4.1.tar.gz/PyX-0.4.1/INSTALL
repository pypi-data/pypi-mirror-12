The installation of PyX is extremely simple if you have installed
the Python distutils package. If you want to build PyX locally,
just run

   python setup.py build_ext -i

You need the kpathsea header and library files for this.
A system wide installation can be performed with help of

    python setup.py install

or an appropriate variant thereof.
