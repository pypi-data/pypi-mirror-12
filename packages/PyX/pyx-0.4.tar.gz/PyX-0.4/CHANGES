PyX

0.5 (????/??/??):
  TODO:
  - graph module
    - another (the last?!) axis redesign: axispos -> class of its own; remove axis.axiscanvas
    - do not include unneeded line segments when the axis range is set manually
    - allow for an iteration of a graph style, when it is used several times
    - common bboxes for different graphs
    - automatic datafile key title; skip title=None stuff in key
    - exceptions in drawsymbol & friends...
    - 3d graphs, circular graphs
    - symbols + lines -> symbollines (??). Symbols should not allow setting lineattrs, and
      lines not symbolattrs
    - allow for graph.changesymbol.square(size=0.15) etc.
    - rect style (and errorbars?) should use clipping
  - canvas module:
    - default patterns
    - stroke and fill should support trafos
    - make dash length available
    - shouldn't strokepath/fillpath be validated by "strokepath is not None" instead of just "strokepath"
  - path module:
    - reverse needs to be fixed
  - text module:
    - the prolog method of the dvifile class recieves the page now -> return the prolog needed by this page only
    - SlantFont & Co support
    - dvicopy: stdout handling
  - data module:
    - data.data should add line number like data.datafile
    - use csv module (new in 2.3)
  - box module:
    - multiple radii: documentation
  - bbox module:
     - __iadd__ and inplace enlarge, transform,...

0.4 (2003/08/22):
  - graph module:
    - separate texter out of the axispainter
    - axis/partitioner/texter/painter/axispos redesign & interfaces
    - tick.text is renamed to tick.label
    - ticks and labels are renamed to tickpos/tickdist and labelpos/labeldist in partitioning
    - ticks can be used in the part to mix a partitioner with some manual ticks
      -> manualpart and the mix technique is not needed anymore
         (both things are still available and working, but they will be removed in the future)
    - _ensurefrac is implemented inside the frac constructor now; initialization is possible by:
      - a (enum, denom) tuple now (previously there were two arguments)
      - a string (as before via _ensurefrac)
      - exponential strings are allowed as well (e.g. "1e10" etc.)
      - a float (precision is determined by floatprecision -- the number of decimal places)
    - dense -> density
    - axis.maxworse
    - axis interface
  - text module:
    - reset() method for the texrunner
    - automatic restart of a TeX instance with the same preamble (preamble changes are not possible)
    - texmessage.loadfd for accepting font description loading
    - don't bail out on width_index == 0, but mark character invalid instead
    - dvicopy flag
    - support for specials; pyxgraphics flag
    - support psfonts.map: font names, font encodings

    - lentopar methods added including some tests
  - epsfile module:
    - new parameter bbox allows to override the bounding box of the eps file

    - derive TFMError and DVIError correctly from exceptions.Exception
    - close files and pipes, if they are no longer used (thanks to Marcus Mendenhall)
    - remove DeprecationWarning in Python 2.3 (thanks to Marcus Mendenhall)
