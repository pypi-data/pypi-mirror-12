        ================================================
        Mercurial All Paths extension
        ================================================
        
        Push or pull to many (or all) paths at once. 
        
        .. contents::
           :local:
           :depth: 2
        
        .. sectnum::
        
        Usage
        ================================================
        
        Simple::
        
            hg pushall
        
        pushes to all paths defined for the repository (all paths
        returned by ``hg paths`` - usually defined in ``.hg/hgrc``,
        but `Path Pattern`_ paths are also handled).
        
        There is also corresponding::
        
            hg pullall
        
        Instead of using standard paths, you can define and use *groups*::
        
            hg pushall -g publish
        
        pushes to all paths specified in the ``[publish]`` config
        section, which should look like this::
        
            [publish]
            bitbucket = ssh://hg@bitbucket.org/ludovicchabant/piecrust
            github = git+ssh://git@github.com:ludovicchabant/PieCrust.git
            other = ssh://my@own/server
            local = /some/other/place
        
        All standard ``push`` and ``pull`` options can be used::
        
            hg pushall -b branch
        
        or::
        
            hg pullall --force
        
        etc.
        
        Finally, there are::
        
            hg incomingall
        
        and
        
            hg outgoingall
        
        which simply iterate over all paths.
        
        Installation
        =======================================================
        
        From PyPi
        --------------------
        
        If you have working ``pip`` or ``easy_install``::
        
            pip install --user mercurial_all_paths
        
        or maybe::
        
            sudo pip install mercurial_all_paths
        
        Then activate by::
        
            [extensions]
            mercurial_all_paths =
        
        To upgrade, repeat the same command with ``--upgrade`` option, for
        example::
        
            pip install --user --upgrade mercurial_all_paths
        
        From source
        -------------------------------------------------------
        
        Clone this repository::
        
            cd ~/sources
            hg clone https://bitbucket.org/Mekk/mercurial-all_paths/
        
        either::
        
            pip install --user -e mercurial-all_paths
        
        and activate as above, or just activate by full path::
        
            [extensions]
            mercurial_path_pattern = ~/sources/mercurial-path_pattern/mercurial_path_pattern.py
        
        To upgrade, pull and update.
