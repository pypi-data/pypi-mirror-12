~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

- Fixes the counts/results/percentages for votes without results.

- Yeas/Nays on the vote are no longer simple summations if a counter-proposal
  is present. In this case, the absolute total is taken from the winning
  proposition (say the yeas of the proposal or the counter-proposal, but
  not a merge of the two.).
