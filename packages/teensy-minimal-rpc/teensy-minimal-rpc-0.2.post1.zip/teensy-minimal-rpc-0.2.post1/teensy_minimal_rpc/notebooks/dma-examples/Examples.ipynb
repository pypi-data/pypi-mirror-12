    "> ## 21.5.1 eDMA initialization\n",
    "\n",
    "> To initialize the eDMA:\n",
    ">  1. Write to the `CR` if a configuration other than the default is desired.\n",
    "       - e.g., set arbitration scheme to *round-robin* or *fixed-priority*.\n",
    ">  2. Write the channel priority levels to the `DCHPRIn` registers if a configuration other\n",
    ">     than the default is desired.\n",
    ">  3. Enable error interrupts in the `EEI` register if so desired.\n",
    ">  4. Write the 32-byte TCD for each channel that may request service.\n",
    ">  5. Enable any hardware service requests via the ERQ register.\n",
    ">  6. Request channel service via either:\n",
    ">      - Software: setting the `TCDn_CSR[START]`\n",
    ">      - Hardware: slave device asserting its eDMA peripheral request signal\n",
    ">\n",
    "> After any channel requests service, a channel is selected for execution based on the\n",
    "> arbitration and priority levels written into the programmer's model. The eDMA engine\n",
    "> reads the entire TCD, including the TCD control and status fields, as shown in the\n",
    "> following table, for the selected channel into its internal address path module.\n",
    "> As the TCD is read, the first transfer is initiated on the internal bus, unless a\n",
    "> configuration error is detected. Transfers from the source, as defined by `TCDn_SADDR`,\n",
    "> to the destination, as defined by `TCDn_DADDR`, continue until the number of bytes\n",
    "> specified by `TCDn_NBYTES` are transferred.\n",
    "\n",
    "> When the transfer is complete:\n",
    ">  - The eDMA engine's local `TCDn_SADDR`, `TCDn_DADDR`, and `TCDn_CITER` are written back to the main TCD memory \n",
    ">  - Any minor loop channel linking is performed, if enabled\n",
    ">\n",
    "> If the major loop is exhausted, further post processing executes, such as interrupts,\n",
    "> major loop channel linking, and scatter/gather operations, if enabled.\n",
