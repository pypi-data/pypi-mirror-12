Untestable Python System
=======================

A python equivalent of the java application here: https://bitbucket.org/tcbakes/untestable.  The purpose of this project
is to demonstrate how the patterns used in the original Java application can be applied to a python application.
The original Java Untestable project will always be the home for the detailed evolutionary history of the system from its
first spaghetti implementation to final elegant, testable one.  So the deliberate evolutionary steps will not be
repeated here.  For that level of insight, refer to the original project.
