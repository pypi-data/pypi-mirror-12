        - Got both python 2 and 3 to pass tox
            A bit gooned up with using ElementTree.py from both python 2.7 and 3.4
            as starting points for OrderedDict implementations.
            Still much testing to be done.
        - Removed lxml as a requirement
            Modified standard xml library to use OrderedDict so that attribute order
            is maintained with xml file templates
            Wrote an ElementTree wrapper to take care of all the namespace stuff
            that vanilla xml.etree did not.
