        =======
        
        Python class to access studenti.unisr.it (Univerity Vita-Salute San Raffaele, Milano)
        
        ##Why
        
        I always need to interact to the website, that is sometimes slow, and always dumb. Always loose time looking for what I need. Also, they don't want to send email for the content published on the "Bacheca", so one should check every time (how often, then?) for new messages.
        
        This class alleviates the pain.
        
        I provide also some example script that show how simple is the use of the class.
        
        Read the exaples. :)
        
        ##TODO:
        
        -	Find someone that will maintain this next year on
        -	Add features (I'll add them when I'll need them, or if someone asks)
        -	Include DB/generate empty
        
        ###Db structure:  
        the db is used only by the Bacheca, to keep track of the unread messages
        
        ```
         messages:
         id, valid_from, valid_through, from, title, content
        ```
