**auditok**  is a module that can be used as a generic tool for data
tokenization. Although its core motivation is **Acoustic Activity 
Detection** (AAD) and extraction from audio streams (i.e. detect
where a noise/an acoustic activity occurs within an audio stream and
extract the corresponding portion of signal), it can easily be
adapted to other tasks.
