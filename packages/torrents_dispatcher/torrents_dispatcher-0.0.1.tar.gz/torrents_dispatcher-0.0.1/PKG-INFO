Description: Torrents dispatcher
        ===================
        
        If you have split all your seeding torrents into multiple torrent clients, you
        have to deal with multiple watch directories (one or more by client). This
        application allows you to define multiple groups, and then dispatch your
        torrents from a global blackhole to one of your watch directory.
        
        It also allows you to search a torrent in all your download directories.
        
        Installation
        ------------
        
        Just run:
        
        ```
        pip3 install torrents_dispatcher
        ```
        
        The script is compatible with Python 3.4 and more.
        
        
        Configuration
        -------------
        
        Create a configuration file in `~/.config/torrents_dispatcher/config.py`. You
        can have an example of a configuration in the `example` directory.
        
        
        Usage
        -----
        
        Run the application by calling `torrdispatcher`:
        
        ```
        $ torrdispatcher -h
        
        usage: torrdispatcher [-h] [-l LIMIT_TO] [-d] {list,move,search} ...
        
        Dispatch your torrents to your different watchdirs
        
        positional arguments:
          {list,move,search}
            list                list torrent groups
            move                scan and dispatch the torrent files
            search              search in downloads
        
        optional arguments:
          -h, --help            show this help message and exit
          -l LIMIT_TO, --limit LIMIT_TO
                                limit to group names
          -d, --debug           set the debug level
        ```
