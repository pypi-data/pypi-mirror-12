        Django Tribe Client
        =====
        
        Tribe client is a simple Django app to connect your server to the 'Tribe' web service
        (located at http://tribe.greenelab.com).
        
        Detailed documentation is in the "docs" directory.
        
        Quick start
        -----------
        
        1. Add "tribe-client" to your INSTALLED_APPS setting like this::
        
            INSTALLED_APPS = (
                ...
                'tribe_client',
            )
        
        
        2. Include the tribe-client URLconf in your project urls.py like this::
        
            url(r'^tribe_client/', include('tribe_client.urls')),
        
        
        3. Register your client server at http://tribe.greenelab.com/oauth2/applications/. Make sure to:
        
           a. Select "Confidential" under "Client type" and
           b. Select "Authorization Code" under "Authorization grant type"
           c. Enter the client server address plus "/tribe_client/get_token" in the "Redirect uris" box
        
        
        4. Write down the Client id in the "TRIBE_ID" setting and the Client secret in the TRIBE_SECRET setting
           in the settings.py file
        
        
        5. TRIBE_REDIRECT_URI setting should be the address of the client server plus "/tribe_client/get_token"
        
        
        6. Make sure that you have a base.html template that the tribe_client templates can extend
        
        
        7. Make a link that takes the user to the '/tribe_client' url of your website for them to log in using Tribe
