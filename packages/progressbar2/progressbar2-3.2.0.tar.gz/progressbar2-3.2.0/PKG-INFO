            **NOTE:** This version has been completely rewritten and might not be
            100% compatible with the old version. If you encounter any problems
            while using it please let me know:

        A text progress bar is typically used to display the progress of a long
        running operation, providing a visual cue that processing is underway.
        
        The ProgressBar class manages the current progress, and the format of the line
        is given by a number of widgets. A widget is an object that may display
        differently depending on the state of the progress bar. There are many types
        of widgets:
        
         - `Timer`
         - `ETA`
         - `AdaptiveETA`
         - `FileTransferSpeed`
         - `AdaptiveTransferSpeed`
         - `AnimatedMarker`
         - `Counter`
         - `Percentage`
         - `FormatLabel`
         - `SimpleProgress`
         - `Bar`
         - `ReverseBar`
         - `BouncingBar`
         - `RotatingMarker`
        
        The progressbar module is very easy to use, yet very powerful. It will also
        automatically enable features like auto-resizing when the system supports it.

                :tags: python 3
        
                Python 3 support
        
        2011-05-15:
          - Removed parse errors for Python2.4 (no, people *should not* be using it
            but it is only 3 years old and it does not have that many differences)
        
          - split up progressbar.py into logical units while maintaining backwards
            compatability
        
          - Removed MANIFEST.in because it is no longer needed and it was causing
            distribute to show warnings
        
        
        2011-05-14:
          - Changes to directory structure so pip can install from Google Code
          - Python 3.x related fixes (all examples work on Python 3.1.3)
          - Added counters, timers, and action bars for iterators with unknown length
        
        2010-08-29:
          - Refactored some code and made it possible to use a ProgressBar as
            an iterator (actually as an iterator that is a proxy to another iterator).
            This simplifies showing a progress bar in a number of cases.
        
        2010-08-15:
          - Did some minor changes to make it compatible with python 3.
        
        2009-05-31:
          - Included check for calling start before update.
        
        2009-03-21:
          - Improved FileTransferSpeed widget, which now supports an unit parameter,
            defaulting to 'B' for bytes. It will also show B/s, MB/s, etc instead of
            B/s, M/s, etc.
        
        2009-02-24:
          - Updated licensing.
          - Moved examples to separated file.
          - Improved _need_update() method, which is now as fast as it can be. IOW,
            no wasted cycles when an update is not needed.
        
        2008-12-22:
          - Added SimpleProgress widget contributed by Sando Tosi
