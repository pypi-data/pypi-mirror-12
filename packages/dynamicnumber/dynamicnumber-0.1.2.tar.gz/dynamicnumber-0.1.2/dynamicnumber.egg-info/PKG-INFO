Description: Dynamic Number
        ==============
        
        What is it?
        -----------
        
        Dynamic Number dynamically typesets values generated in different kinds
        of scripts in LaTeX through the use of symbolic links. The aim is to
        reduce errors resulting from out-of-date numbers by directly setting
        them in the number generating file and importing a symbolic link in the
        LaTeX source file.
        
        It can be used to import not only numerical values into LaTeX, but even
        strings and pieces of code are possible. The main repository is located
        in `this <https://github.com/opieters/DynamicNumber>`__ repository.
        
        **Attention** The symbolic links mentioned here are ***NOT*** related in
        any kind to the symbolic links used in UNIX systems. See example below
        to see what is meant with a symbolic link.
        
        Installation
        ------------
        
        Depending on your desires, one or more might not be applicable. All the
        supported languages have a file in the ``languages`` folder. Currently
        only MATLAB and Python are supported to produce Dynamic Number (dn) list
        files (also called symbolic link lists).
        
        LaTeX
        ~~~~~
        
        Currently the package is also available on CTAN. This is the preferred
        way of installing LaTeX packages. You can thus download it using your
        favourite (La)TeX package manager. The instructions below are thus
        obsolete.
        
        MATLAB
        ~~~~~~
        
        Add the necessary functions to MATLAB's path.
        
        1. Clone the directory in your MATLAB folder (``Documents/MATLAB``).
        2. Now the contents should be in ``Documents/MATLAB/DynamicNumber``.
        3. Open MATLAB.
        4. Set path to include the cloned folder. The Set path can be found in
           the File menu on older MATLAB installations or HOME, Environment in
           newer installations.
        
        Python
        ~~~~~~
        
        Install with ``pip``: ``sudo pip install dynamicnumber``
        
        Quick start
        -----------
        
        LaTeX
        ~~~~~
        
        LaTeX usage is very straightforward. Load the package with
        ``\usepackage{dynamicnumber}`` and next load a symbolic link lists with
        ``\dnreadfile{list}``. Now you can start using your dynamic variables
        with ``\dnget{variable}``.
        
        More information and additional commands can be found in the
        documentation.
        
        **Attention!** Do not attempt to create a ``pgfkey`` with the name
        ``dynamicnumber``, it will conflict with the internal workings of the
        package.
        
        MATLAB and Python
        ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
        
        Create a symbolic link lists with the ``dn()`` command, then add
        symbolic links with the ``add``-method.
        
        The ``add``-method requires at least 2 arguments: the symbolic link name
        and a value (either numerical or string). The optional third can specify
        a unit for the value. The symbolic link will be stored to typeset both
        number and unit in a nice way, with the ``units`` package
        (``\unit{<value}{<unit>}``).
        
        Example (in Python, MATLAB code is almost identical)
        
        .. code:: python
        
            # Some computations and sensor readout to predict temperature tomorrow:
            temperature = 23.4
            temp_predictions = dn('TemperaturePredictions')
            temp_predictions.add('tomorrow',temparture,'C') # or \\Celcius instead of C
        
        **Note!**: If you wish to use special LaTeX commands such as
        ``\Celcius`` or ``\metre``, your need to be careful with the use of the
        backslash. In MATLAB you only need to add one backslash because of the
        way it is parsed, but in Python you need to add two of them! This is
        needed because the backslash is also used for escape sequences.
        
        Contributions
        -------------
        
        The libraries are basic in a sense that they do not have a lot of
        features or options. This is intentional. Users can easily adopt them to
        suit their own needs without having to go through 100s of lines of code
        and the learning curve is very small. So the main goal is to have a
        library that support many platforms, is (almost) identical on all these
        platforms and is simple to use.
        
        Bug fixes and small feature improvements are always welcome, you can use
        a pull request to add must-have features or perform bug fixes.
