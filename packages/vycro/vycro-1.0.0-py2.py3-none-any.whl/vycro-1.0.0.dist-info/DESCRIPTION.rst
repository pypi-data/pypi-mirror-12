Vycro
=====

``vycro`` is a Python wrapper designed to make calling VBA functions and
subroutines with Microsoft Excel as easy as a couple of standard file
I/O calls.

.. code:: python

    from vycro import MacroWrapper

    mw = MacroWrapper()
    wb_kwargs = {"ReadOnly":"True"}
    m_args = ["arg1", "True", "111"]
    with mw.open_workbook("/full/path/with.extension", **wb_kwargs):
        mw.run_macro("macro_name", *m_args)  # See declaration for function args

``vycro`` currently supports Python 2.7 and Python 3.1-3.5, and requires
pywin32-219.
