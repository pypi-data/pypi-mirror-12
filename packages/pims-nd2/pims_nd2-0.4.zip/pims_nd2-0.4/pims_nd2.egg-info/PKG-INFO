Description: pims\_nd2
        =========
        
        This package lets `pims <https://github.com/soft-matter/pims>`__
        interface with the `ND2SDK <http://www.nd2sdk.com>`__ for fast reading
        of Nikon \*.nd2 files.
        
        This is implemented on Windows, Linux and OSX systems.
        
        Dependencies
        ------------
        
        This reader is based on ``pims.FramesSequenceND``, which is available
        from version 0.3. Apart from
        `pims <https://github.com/soft-matter/pims>`__ there are no extra
        dependencies. The required c libraries are included and will be added to
        the PATH variable at runtime.
        
        Examples
        --------
        
        The following code opens the demo file included in the package and
        iterates through the first 3 frames. Note that frames are only read when
        necessary.
        
        ::
        
            from pims_nd2 import ND2_Reader
            with ND2_Reader('cluster.nd2') as frames:
                frames.iter_axes = 't'
                frames.bundle_axes = 'zyx'
                frames.default_coords['c'] = 1
                for frame in frames[:3]:
                    # do something with 3D frames in channel 1
        
        The best way to use the reader is using a context manager. If you do not
        use a context manager, make sure to call ``frames.close()`` at the end
        of your script.
        
        Metadata access can be done on two levels: reader level and frame level.
        
        ::
        
            frames.metadata['mpp']  # calibration in microns per pixel
            frames[0].metadata['t_ms']  # time of frame in milliseconds
