Description: pims_nd2
        ========
        
        This package lets [pims](https://github.com/soft-matter/pims) interface with the [ND2SDK](http://www.nd2sdk.com) for fast reading of Nikon *.nd2 files.
        Currently, this is only implemented for Windows.
        
        SDKs for Linux and OSX are already included, these are probably easy to implement.
        
        Dependencies
        ------------
        
        This reader is based on `pims.FramesSequenceND`, which is available from version 0.3.0. Apart from [pims](https://github.com/soft-matter/pims) there are no extra dependencies. The required c libraries are included and will be added to the PATH variable at runtime. 
        
        Examples
        --------
        
        The following code opens the demo file included in the package and iterates through the first 3 frames. Note that frames are only read when necessary.
        
            from pims_nd2 import ND2_Reader
            with ND2_Reader('cluster.nd2') as frames:
        		frames.iter_axes = 't'
        		frames.bundle_axes = 'zyx'
        		frames.default_coords['c'] = 1
        		for frame in frames[:3]:
        			# do something with 3D frames in channel 1
        
        The best way to use the reader is using a context manager. If you do not use a context manager, make sure to call `frames.close()` at the end of your script.
        
        Metadata access can be done on two levels: reader level and frame level.
        
        	frames.metadata['mpp']  # calibration in microns per pixel
        	frames[0].metadata['t_ms']  # timestamp of image in milliseconds
