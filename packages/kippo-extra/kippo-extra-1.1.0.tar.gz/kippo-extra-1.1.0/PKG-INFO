Description: kippo-extra
        ===========
        
        Set of extra commands for the kippo SSH honeypot daemon
        (https://github.com/desaster/kippo/).
        
        Provided commands
        -----------------
        
        -  ``/usr/bin/env`` - current environment variables
        -  ``/usr/bin/gcc`` - fake compiler with file output
        -  ``/sbin/iptables`` - fake firewall management, supports flush and
           list for different tables/chains
        -  ``/bin/which`` - path of binary
        -  ``/bin/netstat`` - work in progress
        -  ``/bin/sleep`` - sleep command
        -  ``/bin/uname`` - kernel and OS identification
        
        The commands are based on the x64 build of Debian 5.
        
        Installation
        ------------
        
        Please read the full installation part.
        
        Python 2.7 or later is required (Python 3.x isn't). Install kippo-extra
        via one of the methods below.
        
        -  ``pip install kippo-extra``
        -  ``pip install git+git://github.com/basilfx/kippo-extra.git``.
        
        To check if everything works, you can run
        ``python -c 'import kippo_extra'`` which should not produce any errors.
        
        Kippo doesn't come with a plugin system. Therefore, the kippo source
        should be modified. Open the file ``KIPPO_ROOT/kippo/__init__.py``. By
        default, it is an empty file. Insert the line
        ``from kippo_extra import loader`` and save the file.
        
        Note 1
        ~~~~~~
        
        The commands require you have a fake filesystem ready with fake links to
        the commands. Therefore, make sure the ``/path/to/command`` is in your
        fake filesystem. If a command does not work in a session, try to
        ``touch /path/to/command`` and then try again. If it works now, then you
        do not have the fake links in your fake filesystem.
        
        Note 2
        ~~~~~~
        
        A small portion of the kippo source code is modified at runtime by
        intercepting imports (See PEP302). However, these patches are dependend
        on the version of kippo. At this moment, the patches are based on
        `revision
        4999618 <https://github.com/desaster/kippo/commit/4999618f476ffa3be5e2be88ea11519ab4a86d87>`__.
        In case a new version is available and kippo fails to start, you can try
        to manually apply the patches to the kippo source (see the directory
        ``kippo_extra/patches``). Insert ``PATCH_SOURCE = False`` in
        ``KIPPO_ROOT/kippo/__init__.py`` to disable runtime patching.
        
        Known issues
        ------------
        
        Probably a lot. Of course, not all commands are complete and are
        functional. I have implemented the basic options to make an honeypot
        session more realistic.
