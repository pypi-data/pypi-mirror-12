gicowa.py - GitHub Commit Watcher
=================================

GitHub's *Watch* feature doesn't send notifications when commits are
pushed. This script aims to implement this feature and much more.

Installation
------------

::

    $ sudo apt-get install sendmail
    $ sudo pip install gicowa

Quick setup
-----------

Add the following line to your ``/etc/crontab``:

::

    0 * * * * root gicowa --persist --no-color --mailto myself@mydomain.com lastwatchedcommits MyGitHubUsername sincelast > /tmp/gicowa 2>&1

**That's it.** As long as your machine is running you'll get e-mails
when something gets pushed on a repo you're watching.

    **NOTES:**

    -  The e-mails are likely to be considered as spam until you mark
       one as non-spam in your e-mail client. Or use the ``--mailfrom``
       option.
    -  If you're watching 15 repos or more, you probably want to use the
       ``--credentials`` option to make sure you don't hit the GitHub
       API rate limit.

Other/Advanced usage
--------------------

``gicowa`` is a generic command-line tool with which you can make much
more that just implementing the use case depicted in the introduction.
This section shows what it can.

List repos watched by a user
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

::

    $ gicowa watchlist AurelienLourot
    watchlist AurelienLourot
    AurelienLourot/uncommitted
    AurelienLourot/crouton-emacs-conf
    brillout/FasterWeb
    AurelienLourot/github-commit-watcher

List last commits on a repo
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

::

    $ gicowa lastrepocommits AurelienLourot/github-commit-watcher since 2015 07 05 09 12 00
    lastrepocommits AurelienLourot/github-commit-watcher since 2015-07-05 09:12:00
    Last commit pushed on 2015-07-05 10:48:58
    Committed on 2015-07-05 10:46:27 - Aurelien Lourot - Minor cleanup.
    Committed on 2015-07-05 09:39:01 - Aurelien Lourot - watchlist command implemented.
    Committed on 2015-07-05 09:12:00 - Aurelien Lourot - argparse added.

    **NOTE:** keep in mind that a commit's *committer timestamp* isn't
    the time at which it gets pushed.

    **NOTE:** if you're watching 15 repos or more, you probably want to
    use the ``--credentials`` option to make sure you don't hit the
    GitHub API rate limit.

List last commits since last run
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Any listing command taking a ``since <timestamp>`` argument takes also a
``sincelast`` one. It will then use the time where that same command has
been run for the last time on that machine with the option
``--persist``. This option makes ``gicowa`` remember the last execution
time of each command in ``~/.gicowa``.

::

    $ gicowa --persist lastwatchedcommits AurelienLourot sincelast
    lastwatchedcommits AurelienLourot since 2015-07-05 20:17:46
    $ gicowa --persist lastwatchedcommits AurelienLourot sincelast
    lastwatchedcommits AurelienLourot since 2015-07-05 20:25:33

Send output by e-mail
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

You can send the output of any command to yourself by e-mail:

::

    $ gicowa --no-color --mailto myself@mydomain.com lastwatchedcommits AurelienLourot since 2015 07 04 00 00 00
    lastwatchedcommits AurelienLourot since 2015-07-04 00:00:00

    AurelienLourot/github-commit-watcher - Committed on 2015-07-05 09:07:14 - AurelienLourot - Initial commit
    Sent by e-mail to myself@mydomain.com

--------------

    **NOTES:**

    -  You probably want to use ``--no-color`` because your e-mail
       client is likely not to render the bash color escape sequences
       properly.
    -  The e-mails are likely to be considered as spam until you mark
       one as non-spam in your e-mail client. Or use the ``--mailfrom``
       option.
