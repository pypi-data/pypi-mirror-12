PyDataSentry - Memory for Data Science
======================================

The combination of datasets, questions, and nature of analysis is
growing everyday. Data scientists find it hard to keep track of all
the different datasets they dealt with, what they did with those
datasets, and what they presented to the model-audience (business etc)

pydatasentry package allows auditability of modeling code and data by
logging all relevant information for every single model run (e.g., a
regression) You could use this for audit past results for correctness,
share models and results with peers, search past results to avoid
repition of work.

Note that code is very alpha. Expect it to break often. Please try it
out and give me feedback/create issues.

Please see `docs`_ for detailed documentation.
