Description: The SAM/BAM/CRAM format is a way to store efficiently large numbers
        of alignments, such as those routinely are created by next-generation
        sequencing methods.
        
        This module provides a low-level wrapper around the htslib C-API as
        using cython and a high-level API for convenient access to the data in
        SAM/BAM formatted files. Also included is an interface to the samtools
        command line utilities and the tabix C-API for reading compressed and
        indexed tabular data.
        
        The current version wraps htslib-1.2.1 and samtools-1.2.
