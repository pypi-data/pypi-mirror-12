compliancelib
=============
Machine readable cybersecurity compliance standards library for Python, starting with FISMA and NIST Risk Management Framework

Source code: https://github.com/govready/compliancelib-python

(For more history, see prototype 800-53-Control-Server (https://github.com/govready/800-53-server))

Goal
----

- [x] Full name of control
- [x] Who has responsibility for control (e.g., organization or information system)

Warning
-------
This is early code. There may be errors!

Requirements

	security within the context of organizational information security programs. Role-based security training

	'\nAT-3 (1)\nENVIRONMENTAL CONTROLS\nThe organization provides [Assignment: organization-defined personnel or
	roles] with initial and [Assignment: organization-defined frequency] training in the employment and 
	operation of environmental controls.\nEnvironmental controls include, for example, fire suppression and 
	detection devices/systems, sprinkler systems, handheld fire extinguishers, fixed fire hoses, smoke 
	detectors, temperature/humidity, HVAC, and power within the facility. Organizations identify personnel with 
	specific roles and responsibilities associated with environmental controls requiring specialized training.
	\nPE-1\nPE-13\nPE-14\nPE-15\nAT-3 (2)\nPHYSICAL SECURITY CONTROLS\nThe organization provides [Assignment: 
	organization-defined personnel or roles] with initial and [Assignment: organization-defined frequency] 
	training in the employment and operation of physical security controls.\nPhysical security controls include,
	for example, physical access control devices, physical intrusion alarms, monitoring/surveillance equipment, 
	and security guards (deployment and operating procedures). Organizations identify personnel with specific 
	roles and responsibilities associated with physical security controls requiring specialized training.\nPE-
	2\nPE-3\nPE-4\nPE-5\nAT-3 (3)\nPRACTICAL EXERCISES\nThe organization includes practical exercises in 
	security training that reinforce training objectives.\nPractical exercises may include, for example, 
	security training for software developers that includes simulated cyber attacks exploiting common software 
	vulnerabilities (e.g., buffer overflows), or spear/whale phishing attacks targeted at senior 
	leaders/executives. These types of practical exercises help developers better understand the effects of such
	vulnerabilities and appreciate the need for security coding standards and processes.\nAT-3 (4)\nSUSPICIOUS 
	COMMUNICATIONS AND ANOMALOUS SYSTEM BEHAVIOR\nThe organization provides training to its personnel on [
	Assignment: organization-defined indicators of malicious code] to recognize suspicious communications and 
	anomalous behavior in organizational information systems.\nA well-trained workforce provides another 
	organizational safeguard that can be employed as part of a defense-in-depth strategy to protect 
	organizations against malicious code coming in to organizations via email or the web applications. ersonnel 
	are trained to look for indications of potentially suspicious email (e.g., receiving an unexpected email, 
	receiving an email containing strange or poor grammar, or receiving an email from an unfamiliar sender but 
	who appears to be from a known sponsor or contractor). Personnel are also trained on how to respond to such 
	suspicious email or web communications (e.g., not opening attachments, not clicking on embedded web links, 
	and checking the source of email addresses). For this process to work effectively, all organizational 
	personnel are trained and made aware of what constitutes suspicious communications. Training personnel on 
	how to recognize anomalous behaviors in organizational information systems can potentially provide early 
	warning for the presence of malicious code. Recognition of such anomalous behavior by organizational 
	personnel can supplement automated malicious code detection and protection tools and systems employed by 
	organizations.\n'

Example code for generating list of controls in `YAML` format::

	controllist = ["AT-3", "AU-1", "IR-2"]
	d = dict()
	for id in controllist:
	    c = compliancelib.SecControl(id)
	    d[id] = yaml.load(c.format('yaml'))

	print(yaml.safe_dump(d, default_flow_style=False, encoding='utf-8', allow_unicode=True,
		explicit_start=True, explicit_end=True))

Example code for generating list of controls in `control-masonry` format::

	controllist = ["AT-3", "AU-1", "IR-2"]
	d = dict()
	for id in controllist:
	    c = compliancelib.SecControl(id)
	    d[id] = yaml.load(c.format('control-masonry'))

	print(yaml.safe_dump(d, default_flow_style=False, encoding='utf-8', allow_unicode=True,
		explicit_start=True, explicit_end=True))

To see control dependencies, simply do in python shell::

	>>> import compliancelib
	>>> cv = compliancelib.SecControlViz("AU-3")
	>>> cv.precursor_controls
	['AU-3', 'AU-2', 'RA-3', 'PM-9']


Running tests
