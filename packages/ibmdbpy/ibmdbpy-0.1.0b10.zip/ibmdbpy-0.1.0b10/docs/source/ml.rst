Machine Learning Algorithms
***************************

Ibmdbpy is a wrapper for machine learning algorithms that are available in dashDB/DB2. Currently available in ibmdbpy are: Kmeans, Naive Bayes, Association Rules. DashDB/DB2 supports several other data mining algorithms so this list may be extended in the future. In this part you will find all documentation related to each of them.
