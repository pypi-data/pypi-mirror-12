Ibmdbpy is an open-source project developed at IBM. Ibmdbpy provides a Python interface for data manipulation and in-database algorithms in IBM dashDB/DB2 and accelerates Python Analytics by seamlessly pushing operations written in Python into the underlying database for execution to benefit from in-database performance-enhancing features such as columnar store and parallel processing.
