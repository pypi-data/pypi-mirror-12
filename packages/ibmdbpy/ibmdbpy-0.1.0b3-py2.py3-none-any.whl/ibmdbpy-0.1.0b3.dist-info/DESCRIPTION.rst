Ibmdbpy is an open-source project developed at IBM. Ibmdbpy provides a Python interface for data manipulation and in-database algorithms in IBM dashDB/DB2 and accelerates Python Analytics by seamlessly pushing operations written in Python into the underlying database for execution to benefit from in-database performance-enhancing features such as columnar store and parallel processing. 

IBM dashDB is a database management system available on IBM BlueMix, the cloud application development and analytics platform powered by IBM. Ibmdbpy can be used by Python developers with very little additional knowledge, since it copies the well-known interface of the Pandas library for data manipulation and the Scikit-learn library for machine learning algorithms. 

Ibmdbpy is a cross-platform project compatible from Python 2.7 up to 3.4 and supports the connection to dashDB/DB2 instances via ODBC or JDBC.
