class Batch(object):

    """
    Creates a series of celery tasks OCRing a set of documents (among other
    things).

    A batch contains three level of definitions: tasks, ticks, and steps. A
    task is a singular operation on an input document, creating a single output
    document, e.g. binarization using a particular configuration of an
    algorithm or OCR using a particular engine. Multiple tasks executing in
    parallel are grouped into a tick and multiple ticks (running sequentially)
    are grouped into steps which again are executed sequentially.

    The need for steps and ticks arises from two different execution orders
    required by a pipeline. Take the following example:

        step 1:
            tick a: task 1
            tick b: task 2, task 3
            tick c: task 4, task 5

    The pipeline expands this example to the following sequences run in
    parallel (dot product of all ticks):

        task 1 -> task 2 -> task 4
        task 1 -> task 2 -> task 5
        task 1 -> task 3 -> task 4
        task 1 -> task 3 -> task 5

    It is not garantueed that any particular task in another sequence has
    executed successfully before a task in a sequence is run, i.e. it is not
    ensured that all task 1's have finished before task 2 of the first sequence
    is executed, except the task(s) further up the sequence.

    Steps on the other hand ensure that all tasks of the previous step have
    finished successfully. The output(s) of the expanded ticks is aggregated
    into a single list and used as the input of the first tick of the step.
    Expanding on the example the following step is added:

        step 2:
            tick d: task 6

    After the 4 sequence are finished their output is aggregated into a list
    [d1, d2, d3, d4] and used as the input of task 6. The final output of task
    6 is the output of the pipeline.

    The call order to create this example is:

        Batch.add_step()
        Batch.add_tick()
        Batch.add_task(task_1)
        Batch.add_tick()
        Batch.add_task(task_2)
        Batch.add_task(task_3)

        Batch.add_task(task_5)
