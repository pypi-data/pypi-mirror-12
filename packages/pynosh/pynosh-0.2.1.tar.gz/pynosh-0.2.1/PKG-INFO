        PyNosh is a solver package for nonlinear Schrödinger equations. It
        contains the respective model evaluators along with an implementation of
        Newton's method and optional preconditioner for its linearization.
        
        PyNosh uses `KryPy <https://github.com/andrenarchy/krypy>`__ for the
        solution of linear equation systems and employs its deflation
        capabilities. The package `VoroPy <https://github.com/nschloe/voropy>`__
        is used to construct the finite-volume discrezation.

        Example
        ~~~~~~~
        
        |Ginzburg-Landau solution| |Ginzburg-Landau solution|
        
        Absolute value and complex argument of a solution of the
        *Ginzburg-Landau equations*, a particular instance of nonlinear
        Schrödinger equations. The number of nodes in the discretization is
        72166 for this example.
