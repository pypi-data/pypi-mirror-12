Description: credkeep
        ========
        
        credkeep is a python package that helps ease the pain of storing sensitive credentials. Credentials that are securely
        encrypted using AWS's Key Management Service (KMS) can be stored in version control systems where they cannot be
        decrypted without access to a users encryption key on KMS.
