Description: Rhizom
        ======
        
        Rhizom is a web application that can display efficiently a network of relationships.
        
        It is based on `Flask`_, and the graph is displayed using `D3.js`_.
        
        Authentication is handled by `Mozilla Persona`_.
        
        - Download it from PyPI: https://pypi.python.org/pypi/rhizom

        Installation
        ------------
        
        If you are unfamiliar with the way Flask applications are usually deployed,
        check out `the official documentation`_ on Flask's website.

        Rhizom provides some configuration examples to help you get started with common
        deployment cases, check out the ``deploy`` subdirectory.
        
        
        Quickstart
        ----------
        This is how you can quickly check out Rhizom. Those steps are not fit for a
        proper production deployment.
        
        Install Rhizom's dependencies. Do do that you can either use your
        distribution's package manager or create a Python VirtualEnv with the following
        commands::
        
            $ virtualenv venv
            $ source ./venv/bin/activate
            $ pip install -r requirements.txt
        
        Create a configuration file called ``config.py`` with the following content::
        
            import os
            basedir = os.path.abspath(os.path.dirname(__file__))
            DEBUG = True
            SQLALCHEMY_DATABASE_URI = 'sqlite:///' + os.path.join(basedir, 'rhizom.db')
            BROWSERID_AUDIENCE = ["http://127.0.0.1:5000"]
            SECRET_KEY = 'JustHavingALook,ThankYou'
            ADMINS = ("your-email-address@your-domain.com")
            PROPAGATE_EXCEPTIONS = True
        
        Now initialize the database with the follwing command::
        
            $ RHIZOM_SETTINGS=`pwd`/config.py python rhizom/scripts.py initdb
        
        Finally, start Rhizom with the following command::
        
            $ RHIZOM_SETTINGS=`pwd`/config.py python rhizom/scripts.py runserver
        
        The console should show you the URL to visit, usually `http://127.0.0.1:5000
        <http://127.0.0.1:5000>`_. You can now login (using the Persona button) and
        start creating graphs.
        
        I hope you'll like it. Feedback is very welcome!
