Description: SMART FHIR Client
        =================
        
        This is _fhirclient_, a flexible Python client for [FHIR][] servers supporting the [SMART on FHIR][smart] protocol.
        The client is compatible with Python 2.7, possibly earlier, and Python 3.
        
        Client versioning is not identical to FHIR versioning.
        The `master` branch is usually on the latest version, possibly on bugfix releases thereof.
        
           Version |          FHIR | &nbsp;

           **1.0** |       `1.0.1` | (DSTU 2)
           **0.5** |  `0.5.0.5149` | (DSTU 2 Ballot, May 2015)

        Installation
        ------------
        
            pip install fhirclient
        
        
        Documentation
        -------------
        
        Technical documentation is available at [docs.smarthealthit.org/client-py/][docs].
        
        #### Flask App
        
        Take a look at [`flask_app.py`][flask_app] to see how you can use the client in a simple (Flask) app.
        This app starts a webserver, listening on [_localhost:8000_](http://localhost:8000), and prompts you to login to our sandbox server and select a patient.
        It then goes on to retrieve the selected patient's demographics and med prescriptions and lists them in a simple HTML page.
        
        The Flask demo app has separate requirements.
        Clone the _client-py_ repository, then best create a virtual environment and install the needed packages like so:
        
            git clone https://github.com/smart-on-fhir/client-py.git
            cd client-py
            virtualenv -p python3 env
            . env/bin/activate
            pip install -r requirements_flask_app.txt
            python flask_app.py
        
        
        Building Distribution
        ---------------------
        
            pip install -r requirements.txt
            python setup.py sdist
            python setup.py bdist_wheel
        
        
        ### Incrementing the lib version
        
            bumpversion patch
            bumpversion minor
            bumpversion major
        
        
        Docs Generation
        ---------------
        
        Docs are generated with [Doxygen][] and [doxypypy][].
        You will need to install doxypypy the old-fashioned way, checking out the repo and issuing `python setup.py install`.
        Then you can just run Doxygen, configuration is stored in the `Doxyfile`.
        
        Running Doxygen will put the generated documentation into `docs`, the HTML files into `docs/html`.
        Those files make up the content of the `gh-pages` branch.
        I usually perform a second checkout of the _gh-pages_ branch and copy the html files over, with:
        
            doxygen
            rsync -a docs/html/ ../client-py-web/
