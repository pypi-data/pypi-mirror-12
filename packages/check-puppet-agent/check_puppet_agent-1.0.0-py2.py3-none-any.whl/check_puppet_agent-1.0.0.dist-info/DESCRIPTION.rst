wywygmbh/check-puppet-agent
===========================

A small script with few dependencies to check the status of puppet agent
runs

It is tested as a sensu check plugin, but also compatible with
nagios/icinga/... due to the similar exit codes

Installation
------------

dependencies
~~~~~~~~~~~~

The requirements are just:

-  ``argparse`` (command line argument parsing)
-  ``yaml`` (to read the puppet state files)
-  ``six`` (python 2 and 3 compatibility)

pip
~~~

The package is easily available on pypi and can be just installed with
pip, this also includes the command line script

$ pip install check-puppet-agent

RPM
~~~

Currently there are no prebuilt RPM packages provided, but you can built
them by yourself with some simple commands

$ git clone ... $ cd check-puppet-agent $ python setup.py bdist\_rpm

Usage
-----

Note: The script is to run as puppet user or root, otherwise it is not
able to read the required files

::

    $ check-puppet-agent
    [CRITICAL] applying catalog compiled at 2015-12-06 21:50:21 (1 days 20 hours 3 minutes 23 seconds ago)
    [      OK] last run on 2015-12-08 17:36:19 (17 minutes 25 seconds ago)
    [      OK] => last run took 11 seconds

Sample if the agent is disabled by ``puppet agent --disable "test"``

::

    $ check-puppet-agent
    [ WARNING] puppet agent is disabled - reason: test

    [      OK] => last run took 11 seconds
