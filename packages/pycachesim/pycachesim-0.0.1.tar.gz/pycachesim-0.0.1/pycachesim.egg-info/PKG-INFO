Description: pycachesim
        ==========
        
        A single-core cache hierarchy simulator written in python.
        
        The goal is to accurately simulate the caching (allocation/hit/miss/replace/evict) behavior of all cache levels found in modern processors. It is developed as a backend to `kerncraft <https://github.com/RRZE-HPC/kerncraft>`_, but is also planned to introduce a command line interface to replay LOAD/STORE instructions.
        
        ..
            This requires:
                * implementation of cache replacement strategies (foremost LRU)
                * implementation of associativity rules (e.g. full-associative, 2-way associativity)
                * rules to define the interaction between memory levels (e.g. inclusive, write-allocate)
            
            Features:
                * take a memory access stream and report statistics
                * operate on absolute and relative (offset) memory addresses
                * ignore a warm-up phase (bringing the simulator into a steady state)
            
            Possible features:
                * report timeline of events
                * Instruction caching (planned are only data caches)
